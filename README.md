|**2024-04-27**|**An Attention-Based Deep Learning Architecture for Real-Time Monocular Visual Odometry: Applications to GPS-free Drone Navigation**|Drones are increasingly used in fields like industry, medicine, research, disaster relief, defense, and security. Technical challenges, such as navigation in GPS-denied environments, hinder further adoption. Research in visual odometry is advancing, potentially solving GPS-free navigation issues. Traditional visual odometry methods use geometry-based pipelines which, while popular, often suffer from error accumulation and high computational demands. Recent studies utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown improved performance, addressing these drawbacks. Deep visual odometry typically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and sequence modeling networks like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to interpret scenes and deduce visual odometry from video sequences. This paper presents a novel real-time monocular visual odometry model for drones, using a deep neural architecture with a self-attention module. It estimates the ego-motion of a camera on a drone, using consecutive video frames. An inference utility processes the live video feed, employing deep learning to estimate the drone's trajectory. The architecture combines a CNN for image feature extraction and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a multi-head attention module for video sequence modeling. Tested on two visual odometry datasets, this model converged 48% faster than a previous RNN model and showed a 22% reduction in mean translational drift and a 12% improvement in mean translational absolute trajectory error, demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. et.al.|[2404.17745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17745)|null|
|**2024-04-26**|**Camera Motion Estimation from RGB-D-Inertial Scene Flow**|In this paper, we introduce a novel formulation for camera motion estimation that integrates RGB-D images and inertial data through scene flow. Our goal is to accurately estimate the camera motion in a rigid 3D environment, along with the state of the inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our proposed method offers the flexibility to operate as a multi-frame optimization or to marginalize older data, thus effectively utilizing past measurements. To assess the performance of our method, we conducted evaluations using both synthetic data from the ICL-NUIM dataset and real data sequences from the OpenLORIS-Scene dataset. Our results show that the fusion of these two sensors enhances the accuracy of camera motion estimation when compared to using only visual data. et.al.|[2404.17251](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17251)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Multi-Session SLAM with Differentiable Wide-Baseline Pose Optimization**|We introduce a new system for Multi-Session SLAM, which tracks camera motion across multiple disjoint videos under a single global reference. Our approach couples the prediction of optical flow with solver layers to estimate camera pose. The backbone is trained end-to-end using a novel differentiable solver for wide-baseline two-view pose. The full system can connect disjoint sequences, perform visual odometry, and global optimization. Compared to existing approaches, our design is accurate and robust to catastrophic failures.

|**2024-04-18**|**SPOT: Point Cloud Based Stereo Visual Place Recognition for Similar and Opposing Viewpoints**|Recognizing places from an opposing viewpoint during a return trip is a common experience for human drivers. However, the analogous robotics capability, visual place recognition (VPR) with limited field of view cameras under 180 degree rotations, has proven to be challenging to achieve. To address this problem, this paper presents Same Place Opposing Trajectory (SPOT), a technique for opposing viewpoint VPR that relies exclusively on structure estimated through stereo visual odometry (VO). The method extends recent advances in lidar descriptors and utilizes a novel double (similar and opposing) distance matrix sequence matching method. We evaluate SPOT on a publicly available dataset with 6.7-7.6 km routes driven in similar and opposing directions under various lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 91.7% recall at 100% precision in opposing viewpoint cases, while requiring less storage than all baselines tested and running faster than all but one. Moreover, the proposed method assumes no a priori knowledge of whether the viewpoint is similar or opposing, and also demonstrates competitive performance in similar viewpoint cases. et.al.|[2404.12339](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12339)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**VBR: A Vision Benchmark in Rome**|This paper presents a vision and perception research dataset collected in Rome, featuring RGB data, 3D point clouds, IMU, and GPS data. We introduce a new benchmark targeting visual odometry and SLAM, to advance the research in autonomous robotics and computer vision. This work complements existing datasets by simultaneously addressing several issues, such as environment diversity, motion patterns, and sensor frequency. It uses up-to-date devices and presents effective procedures to accurately calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic of the sensors while addressing temporal synchronization. During recording, we cover multi-floor buildings, gardens, urban and highway scenarios. Combining handheld and car-based data collections, our setup can simulate any robot (quadrupeds, quadrotors, autonomous vehicles). The dataset includes an accurate 6-dof ground truth based on a novel methodology that refines the RTK-GPS estimate with LiDAR point clouds through Bundle Adjustment. All sequences divided in training and testing are accessible through our website. et.al.|[2404.11322](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11322)|**[link](https://github.com/rvp-group/vbr-devkit)**|
|**2024-04-14**|**Increasing SLAM Pose Accuracy by Ground-to-Satellite Image Registration**|Vision-based localization for autonomous driving has been of great interest among researchers. When a pre-built 3D map is not available, the techniques of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are typically adopted. Due to error accumulation, visual SLAM (vSLAM) usually suffers from long-term drift. This paper proposes a framework to increase the localization accuracy by fusing the vSLAM with a deep-learning-based ground-to-satellite (G2S) image registration method. In this framework, a coarse (spatial correlation bound check) to fine (visual odometry consistency check) method is designed to select the valid G2S prediction. The selected prediction is then fused with the SLAM measurement by solving a scaled pose graph problem. To further increase the localization accuracy, we provide an iterative trajectory fusion pipeline. The proposed framework is evaluated on two well-known autonomous driving datasets, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness in terms of vehicle localization. et.al.|[2404.09169](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09169)|null|
|**2024-04-06**|**Salient Sparse Visual Odometry With Pose-Only Supervision**|Visual Odometry (VO) is vital for the navigation of autonomous systems, providing accurate position and orientation estimates at reasonable costs. While traditional VO methods excel in some conditions, they struggle with challenges like variable lighting and motion blur. Deep learning-based VO, though more adaptable, can face generalization problems in new environments. Addressing these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel hybrid visual odometry (VO) framework that leverages pose-only supervision, offering a balanced solution between robustness and the need for extensive labeling. We propose two cost-effective and innovative designs: a self-supervised homographic pre-training for enhancing optical flow learning from pose-only labels and a random patch-based salient point detection strategy for more accurate optical flow patch extraction. These designs eliminate the need for dense optical flow labels for training and significantly improve the generalization capability of the system in diverse and challenging environments. Our pose-only supervised method achieves competitive performance on standard datasets and greater robustness and generalization ability in extreme and unseen scenarios, even compared to dense optical flow-supervised state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2404.04677](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04677)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**A Comparative Analysis of Visual Odometry in Virtual and Real-World Railways Environments**|Perception tasks play a crucial role in the development of automated operations and systems across multiple application fields. In the railway transportation domain, these tasks can improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of various perations, including train localization, signal recognition, and track discrimination. However, collecting considerable and precisely labeled datasets for testing such novel algorithms poses extreme challenges in the railway environment due to the severe restrictions in accessing the infrastructures and the practical difficulties associated with properly equipping trains with the required sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs. The remarkable innovations of graphic engine tools offer new solutions to craft realistic synthetic datasets. To illustrate the advantages of employing graphic simulation for early-stage testing of perception tasks in the railway domain, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of a SLAM algorithm applied both in a virtual synthetic environment and a real-world scenario. The analysis leverages virtual railway environments created with the latest version of Unreal Engine, facilitating data collection and allowing the examination of challenging scenarios, including low-visibility, dangerous operational modes, and complex environments. The results highlight the feasibility and potentiality of graphic simulation to advance perception tasks in the railway domain. et.al.|[2403.17084](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17084)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**On Designing Consistent Covariance Recovery from a Deep Learning Visual Odometry Engine**|Deep learning techniques have significantly advanced in providing accurate visual odometry solutions by leveraging large datasets. However, generating uncertainty estimates for these methods remains a challenge. Traditional sensor fusion approaches in a Bayesian framework are well-established, but deep learning techniques with millions of parameters lack efficient methods for uncertainty estimation.   This paper addresses the issue of uncertainty estimation for pre-trained deep-learning models in monocular visual odometry. We propose formulating a factor graph on an implicit layer of the deep learning network to recover relative covariance estimates, which allows us to determine the covariance of the Visual Odometry (VO) solution. We showcase the consistency of the deep learning engine's covariance approximation with an empirical analysis of the covariance model on the EUROC datasets to demonstrate the correctness of our formulation. et.al.|[2403.13170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13170)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**The POLAR Traverse Dataset: A Dataset of Stereo Camera Images Simulating Traverses across Lunar Polar Terrain under Extreme Lighting Conditions**|We present the POLAR Traverse Dataset: a dataset of high-fidelity stereo pair images of lunar-like terrain under polar lighting conditions designed to simulate a straight-line traverse. Images from individual traverses with different camera heights and pitches were recorded at 1 m intervals by moving a suspended stereo bar across a test bed filled with regolith simulant and shaped to mimic lunar south polar terrain. Ground truth geometry and camera position information was also recorded. This dataset is intended for developing and testing software algorithms that rely on stereo or monocular camera images, such as visual odometry, for use in the lunar polar environment, as well as to provide insight into the expected lighting conditions in lunar polar regions. et.al.|[2403.12194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12194)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**An Accurate and Real-time Relative Pose Estimation from Triple Point-line Images by Decoupling Rotation and Translation**|Line features are valid complements for point features in man-made environments. 3D-2D constraints provided by line features have been widely used in Visual Odometry (VO) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. However, how to accurately solve three-view relative motion only with 2D observations of points and lines in real time has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel three-view pose solver based on rotation-translation decoupled estimation. First, a high-precision rotation estimation method based on normal vector coplanarity constraints that consider the uncertainty of observations is proposed, which can be solved by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm efficiently. Second, a robust linear translation constraint that minimizes the degree of the rotation components and feature observation components in equations is elaborately designed for estimating translations accurately. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world data show that the proposed approach improves both rotation and translation accuracy compared to the classical trifocal-tensor-based method and the state-of-the-art two-view algorithm in outdoor and indoor environments. et.al.|[2403.11639](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11639)|null|
|**2024-03-16**|**Efficient Domain Adaptation for Endoscopic Visual Odometry**|Visual odometry plays a crucial role in endoscopic imaging, yet the scarcity of realistic images with ground truth poses poses a significant challenge. Therefore, domain adaptation offers a promising approach to bridge the pre-operative planning domain with the intra-operative real domain for learning odometry information. However, existing methodologies suffer from inefficiencies in the training time. In this work, an efficient neural style transfer framework for endoscopic visual odometry is proposed, which compresses the time from pre-operative planning to testing phase to less than five minutes. For efficient traing, this work focuses on training modules with only a limited number of real images and we exploit pre-operative prior information to dramatically reduce training duration. Moreover, during the testing phase, we propose a novel Test Time Adaptation (TTA) method to mitigate the gap in lighting conditions between training and testing datasets. Experimental evaluations conducted on two public endoscope datasets showcase that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in visual odometry tasks while boasting the fastest training speeds. These results demonstrate significant promise for intra-operative surgery applications. et.al.|[2403.10860](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10860)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**Visual Inertial Odometry using Focal Plane Binary Features (BIT-VIO)**|Focal-Plane Sensor-Processor Arrays (FPSP)s are an emerging technology that can execute vision algorithms directly on the image sensor. Unlike conventional cameras, FPSPs perform computation on the image plane -- at individual pixels -- enabling high frame rate image processing while consuming low power, making them ideal for mobile robotics. FPSPs, such as the SCAMP-5, use parallel processing and are based on the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) paradigm. In this paper, we present BIT-VIO, the first Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) which utilises SCAMP-5.BIT-VIO is a loosely-coupled iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF) which fuses together the visual odometry running fast at 300 FPS with predictions from 400 Hz IMU measurements to provide accurate and smooth trajectories. et.al.|[2403.09882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09882)|null|
|**2024-03-02**|**Grid-based Fast and Structural Visual Odometry**|In the field of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), researchers have always pursued better performance in terms of accuracy and time cost. Traditional algorithms typically rely on fundamental geometric elements in images to establish connections between frames. However, these elements suffer from disadvantages such as uneven distribution and slow extraction. In addition, geometry elements like lines have not been fully utilized in the process of pose estimation. To address these challenges, we propose GFS-VO, a grid-based RGB-D visual odometry algorithm that maximizes the utilization of both point and line features. Our algorithm incorporates fast line extraction and a stable line homogenization scheme to improve feature processing. To fully leverage hidden elements in the scene, we introduce Manhattan Axes (MA) to provide constraints between local map and current frame. Additionally, we have designed an algorithm based on breadth-first search for extracting plane normal vectors. To evaluate the performance of GFS-VO, we conducted extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm exhibits significant improvements in both time cost and accuracy compared to existing approaches. et.al.|[2403.01110](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01110)|null|
|**2024-02-25**|**VOLoc: Visual Place Recognition by Querying Compressed Lidar Map**|The availability of city-scale Lidar maps enables the potential of city-scale place recognition using mobile cameras. However, the city-scale Lidar maps generally need to be compressed for storage efficiency, which increases the difficulty of direct visual place recognition in compressed Lidar maps. This paper proposes VOLoc, an accurate and efficient visual place recognition method that exploits geometric similarity to directly query the compressed Lidar map via the real-time captured image sequence. In the offline phase, VOLoc compresses the Lidar maps using a \emph{Geometry-Preserving Compressor} (GPC), in which the compression is reversible, a crucial requirement for the downstream 6DoF pose estimation. In the online phase, VOLoc proposes an online Geometric Recovery Module (GRM), which is composed of online Visual Odometry (VO) and a point cloud optimization module, such that the local scene structure around the camera is online recovered to build the \emph{Querying Point Cloud} (QPC). Then the QPC is compressed by the same GPC, and is aggregated into a global descriptor by an attention-based aggregation module, to query the compressed Lidar map in the vector space. A transfer learning mechanism is also proposed to improve the accuracy and the generality of the aggregation network. Extensive evaluations show that VOLoc provides localization accuracy even better than the Lidar-to-Lidar place recognition, setting up a new record for utilizing the compressed Lidar map by low-end mobile cameras. The code are publicly available at https://github.com/Master-cai/VOLoc. et.al.|[2402.15961](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15961)|**[link](https://github.com/master-cai/voloc)**|
|**2024-02-22**|**Secure Navigation using Landmark-based Localization in a GPS-denied Environment**|In modern battlefield scenarios, the reliance on GPS for navigation can be a critical vulnerability. Adversaries often employ tactics to deny or deceive GPS signals, necessitating alternative methods for the localization and navigation of mobile troops. Range-free localization methods such as DV-HOP rely on radio-based anchors and their average hop distance which suffers from accuracy and stability in a dynamic and sparse network topology. Vision-based approaches like SLAM and Visual Odometry use sensor fusion techniques for map generation and pose estimation that are more sophisticated and computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict the future state of moving entities along the battlefield. Our framework utilizes safe trajectory information generated by the troop control center by considering identifiable landmarks and pre-defined hazard maps. It performs point inclusion tests on the convex hull of the trajectory segments to ensure the safety and survivability of a moving entity and determines the next point forward decisions. We present a simulated battlefield scenario for two different approaches (with EKF and without EKF) that guide a moving entity through an obstacle and hazard-free path. Using the proposed method, we observed a percent error of 6.51% lengthwise in safe trajectory estimation with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 2.97m and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 3.27m. The results demonstrate that our approach not only ensures the safety of the mobile units by keeping them within the secure trajectory but also enhances operational effectiveness by adapting to the evolving threat landscape. et.al.|[2402.14280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14280)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**Landmark-based Localization using Stereo Vision and Deep Learning in GPS-Denied Battlefield Environment**|Localization in a battlefield environment is increasingly challenging as GPS connectivity is often denied or unreliable, and physical deployment of anchor nodes across wireless networks for localization can be difficult in hostile battlefield terrain. Existing range-free localization methods rely on radio-based anchors and their average hop distance which suffers from accuracy and stability in dynamic and sparse wireless network topology. Vision-based methods like SLAM and Visual Odometry use expensive sensor fusion techniques for map generation and pose estimation. This paper proposes a novel framework for localization in non-GPS battlefield environments using only the passive camera sensors and considering naturally existing or artificial landmarks as anchors. The proposed method utilizes a customcalibrated stereo vision camera for distance estimation and the YOLOv8s model, which is trained and fine-tuned with our real-world dataset for landmark recognition. The depth images are generated using an efficient stereomatching algorithm, and distances to landmarks are determined by extracting the landmark depth feature utilizing a bounding box predicted by the landmark recognition model. The position of the unknown node is then obtained using the efficient least square algorithm and then optimized using the L-BFGS-B (limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization) method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework performs better than existing anchorbased DV-Hop algorithms and competes with the most efficient vision-based algorithms in terms of localization error (RMSE). et.al.|[2402.12551](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12551)|null|
|**2024-02-07**|**Online and Certifiably Correct Visual Odometry and Mapping**|This paper proposes two new algorithms for certified perception in safety-critical robotic applications. The first is a Certified Visual Odometry algorithm, which uses a RGBD camera with bounded sensor noise to construct a visual odometry estimate with provable error bounds. The second is a Certified Mapping algorithm which, using the same RGBD images, constructs a Signed Distance Field of the obstacle environment, always safely underestimating the distance to the nearest obstacle. This is required to avoid errors due to VO drift. The algorithms are demonstrated in hardware experiments, where we demonstrate both running online at 30FPS. The methods are also compared to state-of-the-art techniques for odometry and mapping. et.al.|[2402.05254](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05254)|null|
|**2024-02-06**|**YOLOPoint Joint Keypoint and Object Detection**|Intelligent vehicles of the future must be capable of understanding and navigating safely through their surroundings. Camera-based vehicle systems can use keypoints as well as objects as low- and high-level landmarks for GNSS-independent SLAM and visual odometry. To this end we propose YOLOPoint, a convolutional neural network model that simultaneously detects keypoints and objects in an image by combining YOLOv5 and SuperPoint to create a single forward-pass network that is both real-time capable and accurate. By using a shared backbone and a light-weight network structure, YOLOPoint is able to perform competitively on both the HPatches and KITTI benchmarks. et.al.|[2402.03989](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03989)|**[link](https://github.com/unibwtas/yolopoint)**|
|**2024-01-19**|**Motion Consistency Loss for Monocular Visual Odometry with Attention-Based Deep Learning**|Deep learning algorithms have driven expressive progress in many complex tasks. The loss function is a core component of deep learning techniques, guiding the learning process of neural networks. This paper contributes by introducing a consistency loss for visual odometry with deep learning-based approaches. The motion consistency loss explores repeated motions that appear in consecutive overlapped video clips. Experimental results show that our approach increased the performance of a model on the KITTI odometry benchmark. et.al.|[2401.10857](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10857)|null|
|**2024-01-17**|**Event-Based Visual Odometry on Non-Holonomic Ground Vehicles**|Despite the promise of superior performance under challenging conditions, event-based motion estimation remains a hard problem owing to the difficulty of extracting and tracking stable features from event streams. In order to robustify the estimation, it is generally believed that fusion with other sensors is a requirement. In this work, we demonstrate reliable, purely event-based visual odometry on planar ground vehicles by employing the constrained non-holonomic motion model of Ackermann steering platforms. We extend single feature n-linearities for regular frame-based cameras to the case of quasi time-continuous event-tracks, and achieve a polynomial form via variable degree Taylor expansions. Robust averaging over multiple event tracks is simply achieved via histogram voting. As demonstrated on both simulated and real data, our algorithm achieves accurate and robust estimates of the vehicle's instantaneous rotational velocity, and thus results that are comparable to the delta rotations obtained by frame-based sensors under normal conditions. We furthermore significantly outperform the more traditional alternatives in challenging illumination scenarios.

|**2024-01-11**|**On State Estimation in Multi-Sensor Fusion Navigation: Optimization and Filtering**|The essential of navigation, perception, and decision-making which are basic tasks for intelligent robots, is to estimate necessary system states. Among them, navigation is fundamental for other upper applications, providing precise position and orientation, by integrating measurements from multiple sensors. With observations of each sensor appropriately modelled, multi-sensor fusion tasks for navigation are reduced to the state estimation problem which can be solved by two approaches: optimization and filtering. Recent research has shown that optimization-based frameworks outperform filtering-based ones in terms of accuracy. However, both methods are based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and should be theoretically equivalent with the same linearization points, observation model, measurements, and Gaussian noise assumption. In this paper, we deeply dig into the theories and existing strategies utilized in both optimization-based and filtering-based approaches. It is demonstrated that the two methods are equal theoretically, but this equivalence corrupts due to different strategies applied in real-time operation. By adjusting existing strategies of the filtering-based approaches, the Monte-Carlo simulation and vehicular ablation experiments based on visual odometry (VO) indicate that the strategy adjusted filtering strictly equals to optimization. Therefore, future research on sensor-fusion problems should concentrate on their own algorithms and strategies rather than state estimation approaches. et.al.|[2401.05836](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05836)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Loss it right: Euclidean and Riemannian Metrics in Learning-based Visual Odometry**|This paper overviews different pose representations and metric functions in visual odometry (VO) networks. The performance of VO networks heavily relies on how their architecture encodes the information. The choice of pose representation and loss function significantly impacts network convergence and generalization. We investigate these factors in the VO network DeepVO by implementing loss functions based on Euler, quaternion, and chordal distance and analyzing their influence on performance. The results of this study provide insights into how loss functions affect the designing of efficient and accurate VO networks for camera motion estimation. The experiments illustrate that a distance that complies with the mathematical requirements of a metric, such as the chordal distance, provides better generalization and faster convergence.

|**2024-01-07**|**Amirkabir campus dataset: Real-world challenges and scenarios of Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) for visually impaired people**|Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms estimate the accurate camera trajectory by using camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The applications of VIO span a diverse range, including augmented reality and indoor navigation. VIO algorithms hold the potential to facilitate navigation for visually impaired individuals in both indoor and outdoor settings. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art VIO algorithms encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments, particularly in densely populated corridors. Existing VIO datasets, e.g., ADVIO, typically fail to effectively exploit these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the Amirkabir campus dataset (AUT-VI) to address the mentioned problem and improve the navigation systems. AUT-VI is a novel and super-challenging dataset with 126 diverse sequences in 17 different locations. This dataset contains dynamic objects, challenging loop-closure/map-reuse, different lighting conditions, reflections, and sudden camera movements to cover all extreme navigation scenarios. Moreover, in support of ongoing development efforts, we have released the Android application for data capture to the public. This allows fellow researchers to easily capture their customized VIO dataset variations. In addition, we evaluate state-of-the-art Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Odometry (VO) methods on our dataset, emphasizing the essential need for this challenging dataset. et.al.|[2401.03604](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03604)|**[link](https://github.com/A3DV/VIRec)**|
|**2024-01-03**|**LEAP-VO: Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking for Visual Odometry**|Visual odometry estimates the motion of a moving camera based on visual input. Existing methods, mostly focusing on two-view point tracking, often ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence, thereby overlooking the global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion, dynamic objects, and low-texture areas. To address these challenges, we present the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively combines visual, inter-track, and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors for dynamic track estimation. Moreover, LEAP's temporal probabilistic formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these traits, we develop LEAP-VO, a robust visual odometry system adept at handling occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks. et.al.|[2401.01887](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01887)|null|
|**2023-12-28**|**SR-LIVO: LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry and Mapping with Sweep Reconstruction**|Existing LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry and mapping (LIV-SLAM) systems mainly utilize the LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) module for structure reconstruction and the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for color rendering. However, the accuracy of VIO is often compromised by photometric changes, weak textures and motion blur, unlike the more robust LIO. This paper introduces SR-LIVO, an advanced and novel LIV-SLAM system employing sweep reconstruction to align reconstructed sweeps with image timestamps. This allows the LIO module to accurately determine states at all imaging moments, enhancing pose accuracy and processing efficiency. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that: 1) our SRLIVO outperforms existing state-of-the-art LIV-SLAM systems in both pose accuracy and time efficiency; 2) our LIO-based pose estimation prove more accurate than VIO-based ones in several mainstream LIV-SLAM systems (including ours). We have released our source code to contribute to the community development in this field. et.al.|[2312.16800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16800)|**[link](https://github.com/ZikangYuan/sr_livo)**|
|**2023-12-20**|**NeRF-VO: Real-Time Sparse Visual Odometry with Neural Radiance Fields**|We introduce a novel monocular visual odometry (VO) system, NeRF-VO, that integrates learning-based sparse visual odometry for low-latency camera tracking and a neural radiance scene representation for sophisticated dense reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our system initializes camera poses using sparse visual odometry and obtains view-dependent dense geometry priors from a monocular depth prediction network. We harmonize the scale of poses and dense geometry, treating them as supervisory cues to train a neural implicit scene representation. NeRF-VO demonstrates exceptional performance in both photometric and geometric fidelity of the scene representation by jointly optimizing a sliding window of keyframed poses and the underlying dense geometry, which is accomplished through training the radiance field with volume rendering. We surpass state-of-the-art methods in pose estimation accuracy, novel view synthesis fidelity, and dense reconstruction quality across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, while achieving a higher camera tracking frequency and consuming less GPU memory. et.al.|[2312.13471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13471)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**Ternary-type Opacity and Hybrid Odometry for RGB-only NeRF-SLAM**|The opacity of rigid 3D scenes with opaque surfaces is considered to be of a binary type. However, we observed that this property is not followed by the existing RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. Therefore, we are motivated to introduce this prior into the RGB-only NeRF-SLAM pipeline. Unfortunately, the optimization through the volumetric rendering function does not facilitate easy integration of the desired prior. Instead, we observed that the opacity of ternary-type (TT) is well supported. In this work, we study why ternary-type opacity is well-suited and desired for the task at hand. In particular, we provide theoretical insights into the process of jointly optimizing radiance and opacity through the volumetric rendering process. Through exhaustive experiments on benchmark datasets, we validate our claim and provide insights into the optimization process, which we believe will unleash the potential of RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. To foster this line of research, we also propose a simple yet novel visual odometry scheme that uses a hybrid combination of volumetric and warping-based image renderings. More specifically, the proposed hybrid odometry (HO) additionally uses image warping-based coarse odometry, leading up to an order of magnitude final speed-up. Furthermore, we show that the proposed TT and HO well complement each other, offering state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in terms of both speed and accuracy. et.al.|[2312.13332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Brain-Inspired Visual Odometry: Balancing Speed and Interpretability through a System of Systems Approach**|In this study, we address the critical challenge of balancing speed and accuracy while maintaining interpretablity in visual odometry (VO) systems, a pivotal aspect in the field of autonomous navigation and robotics. Traditional VO systems often face a trade-off between computational speed and the precision of pose estimation. To tackle this issue, we introduce an innovative system that synergistically combines traditional VO methods with a specifically tailored fully connected network (FCN). Our system is unique in its approach to handle each degree of freedom independently within the FCN, placing a strong emphasis on causal inference to enhance interpretability. This allows for a detailed and accurate assessment of relative pose error (RPE) across various degrees of freedom, providing a more comprehensive understanding of parameter variations and movement dynamics in different environments. Notably, our system demonstrates a remarkable improvement in processing speed without compromising accuracy. In certain scenarios, it achieves up to a 5% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), showcasing its ability to effectively bridge the gap between speed and accuracy that has long been a limitation in VO research. This advancement represents a significant step forward in developing more efficient and reliable VO systems, with wide-ranging applications in real-time navigation and robotic systems. et.al.|[2312.13162](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13162)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Trajectory Approximation of Video Based on Phase Correlation for Forward Facing Camera**|In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for extracting trajectories from a camera sensor in GPS-denied environments, leveraging visual odometry. The system takes video footage captured by a forward-facing camera mounted on a vehicle as input, with the output being a chain code representing the camera's trajectory. The proposed methodology involves several key steps. Firstly, we employ phase correlation between consecutive frames of the video to extract essential information. Subsequently, we introduce a novel chain code method termed "dynamic chain code," which is based on the x-shift values derived from the phase correlation. The third step involves determining directional changes (forward, left, right) by establishing thresholds and extracting the corresponding chain code. This extracted code is then stored in a buffer for further processing. Notably, our system outperforms traditional methods reliant on spatial features, exhibiting greater speed and robustness in noisy environments. Importantly, our approach operates without external camera calibration information. Moreover, by incorporating visual odometry, our system enhances its accuracy in estimating camera motion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory dynamics. Finally, the system culminates in the visualization of the normalized camera motion trajectory. et.al.|[2312.12680](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12680)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Deep Event Visual Odometry**|Event cameras offer the exciting possibility of tracking the camera's pose during high-speed motion and in adverse lighting conditions. Despite this promise, existing event-based monocular visual odometry (VO) approaches demonstrate limited performance on recent benchmarks. To address this limitation, some methods resort to additional sensors such as IMUs, stereo event cameras, or frame-based cameras. Nonetheless, these additional sensors limit the application of event cameras in real-world devices since they increase cost and complicate system requirements. Moreover, relying on a frame-based camera makes the system susceptible to motion blur and HDR. To remove the dependency on additional sensors and to push the limits of using only a single event camera, we present Deep Event VO (DEVO), the first monocular event-only system with strong performance on a large number of real-world benchmarks. DEVO sparsely tracks selected event patches over time. A key component of DEVO is a novel deep patch selection mechanism tailored to event data. We significantly decrease the pose tracking error on seven real-world benchmarks by up to 97% compared to event-only methods and often surpass or are close to stereo or inertial methods. Code is available at https://github.com/tum-vision/DEVO et.al.|[2312.09800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09800)|**[link](https://github.com/tum-vision/devo)**|
|**2023-12-10**|**SuperPrimitive: Scene Reconstruction at a Primitive Level**|Joint camera pose and dense geometry estimation from a set of images or a monocular video remains a challenging problem due to its computational complexity and inherent visual ambiguities. Most dense incremental reconstruction systems operate directly on image pixels and solve for their 3D positions using multi-view geometry cues. Such pixel-level approaches suffer from ambiguities or violations of multi-view consistency (e.g. caused by textureless or specular surfaces).   We address this issue with a new image representation which we call a SuperPrimitive. SuperPrimitives are obtained by splitting images into semantically correlated local regions and enhancing them with estimated surface normal directions, both of which are predicted by state-of-the-art single image neural networks. This provides a local geometry estimate per SuperPrimitive, while their relative positions are adjusted based on multi-view observations.   We demonstrate the versatility of our new representation by addressing three 3D reconstruction tasks: depth completion, few-view structure from motion, and monocular dense visual odometry. et.al.|[2312.05889](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05889)|null|
|**2023-12-04**|**iMatching: Imperative Correspondence Learning**|Learning feature correspondence is a foundational task in computer vision, holding immense importance for downstream applications such as visual odometry and 3D reconstruction. Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence. It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance on tasks including feature matching and pose estimation, in which we obtained an average of 30% accuracy gain over the state-of-the-art matching models. et.al.|[2312.02141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02141)|null|
|**2023-11-30**|**Event-based Visual Inertial Velometer**|Neuromorphic event-based cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors with asynchronous pixels and extremely high temporal resolution. Such favorable properties make them an excellent choice for solving state estimation tasks under aggressive ego motion. However, failures of camera pose tracking are frequently witnessed in state-of-the-art event-based visual odometry systems when the local map cannot be updated in time. One of the biggest roadblocks for this specific field is the absence of efficient and robust methods for data association without imposing any assumption on the environment. This problem seems, however, unlikely to be addressed as in standard vision due to the motion-dependent observability of event data. Therefore, we propose a mapping-free design for event-based visual-inertial state estimation in this paper. Instead of estimating the position of the event camera, we find that recovering the instantaneous linear velocity is more consistent with the differential working principle of event cameras. The proposed event-based visual-inertial velometer leverages a continuous-time formulation that incrementally fuses the heterogeneous measurements from a stereo event camera and an inertial measurement unit. Experiments on the synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can recover instantaneous linear velocity in metric scale with low latency. et.al.|[2311.18189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18189)|null|
|**2023-11-21**|**CoVOR-SLAM: Cooperative SLAM using Visual Odometry and Ranges for Multi-Robot Systems**|A swarm of robots has advantages over a single robot, since it can explore larger areas much faster and is more robust to single-point failures. Accurate relative positioning is necessary to successfully carry out a collaborative mission without collisions. When Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is used to estimate the poses of each robot, inter-agent loop closing is widely applied to reduce the relative positioning errors. This technique can mitigate errors using the feature points commonly observed by different robots. However, it requires significant computing and communication capabilities to detect inter-agent loops, and to process the data transmitted by multiple agents. In this paper, we propose Collaborative SLAM using Visual Odometry and Range measurements (CoVOR-SLAM) to overcome this challenge. In the framework of CoVOR-SLAM, robots only need to exchange pose estimates, covariances (uncertainty) of the estimates, and range measurements between robots. Since CoVOR-SLAM does not require to associate visual features and map points observed by different agents, the computational and communication loads are significantly reduced. The required range measurements can be obtained using pilot signals of the communication system, without requiring complex additional infrastructure. We tested CoVOR-SLAM using real images as well as real ultra-wideband-based ranges obtained with two rovers. In addition, CoVOR-SLAM is evaluated with a larger scale multi-agent setup exploiting public image datasets and ranges generated using a realistic simulation. The results show that CoVOR-SLAM can accurately estimate the robots' poses, requiring much less computational power and communication capabilities than the inter-agent loop closing technique. et.al.|[2311.12580](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12580)|null|
|**2023-11-10**|**Dense Visual Odometry Using Genetic Algorithm**|Our work aims to estimate the camera motion mounted on the head of a mobile robot or a moving object from RGB-D images in a static scene. The problem of motion estimation is transformed into a nonlinear least squares function. Methods for solving such problems are iterative. Various classic methods gave an iterative solution by linearizing this function. We can also use the metaheuristic optimization method to solve this problem and improve results. In this paper, a new algorithm is developed for visual odometry using a sequence of RGB-D images. This algorithm is based on a genetic algorithm. The proposed iterative genetic algorithm searches using particles to estimate the optimal motion and then compares it to the traditional methods. To evaluate our method, we use the root mean square error to compare it with the based energy method and another metaheuristic method. We prove the efficiency of our innovative algorithm on a large set of images. et.al.|[2311.06149](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06149)|null|
|**2023-11-07**|**Inertial Guided Uncertainty Estimation of Feature Correspondence in Visual-Inertial Odometry/SLAM**|Visual odometry and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) has been studied as one of the most important tasks in the areas of computer vision and robotics, to contribute to autonomous navigation and augmented reality systems. In case of feature-based odometry/SLAM, a moving visual sensor observes a set of 3D points from different viewpoints, correspondences between the projected 2D points in each image are usually established by feature tracking and matching. However, since the corresponding point could be erroneous and noisy, reliable uncertainty estimation can improve the accuracy of odometry/SLAM methods. In addition, inertial measurement unit is utilized to aid the visual sensor in terms of Visual-Inertial fusion. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of feature correspondence using an inertial guidance robust to image degradation caused by motion blur, illumination change and occlusion. Modeling a guidance distribution to sample possible correspondence, we fit the distribution to an energy function based on image error, yielding more robust uncertainty than conventional methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by incorporating it into one of recent visual-inertial odometry/SLAM algorithms for public datasets. et.al.|[2311.03722](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03722)|null|
|**2023-10-23**|**Converting Depth Images and Point Clouds for Feature-based Pose Estimation**|In recent years, depth sensors have become more and more affordable and have found their way into a growing amount of robotic systems. However, mono- or multi-modal sensor registration, often a necessary step for further processing, faces many challenges on raw depth images or point clouds. This paper presents a method of converting depth data into images capable of visualizing spatial details that are basically hidden in traditional depth images. After noise removal, a neighborhood of points forms two normal vectors whose difference is encoded into this new conversion. Compared to Bearing Angle images, our method yields brighter, higher-contrast images with more visible contours and more details. We tested feature-based pose estimation of both conversions in a visual odometry task and RGB-D SLAM. For all tested features, AKAZE, ORB, SIFT, and SURF, our new Flexion images yield better results than Bearing Angle images and show great potential to bridge the gap between depth data and classical computer vision.

|**2023-10-17**|**Open-Structure: a Structural Benchmark Dataset for SLAM Algorithms**|This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, Open-Structure, for evaluating visual odometry and SLAM methods, which directly equips point and line measurements, correspondences, structural associations, and co-visibility factor graphs instead of providing raw images. Based on the proposed benchmark dataset, these 2D or 3D data can be directly input to different stages of SLAM pipelines to avoid the impact of the data preprocessing modules in ablation experiments. First, we propose a dataset generator for real-world and simulated scenarios. In real-world scenes, it maintains the same observations and occlusions as actual feature extraction results. Those generated simulation sequences enhance the dataset's diversity by introducing various carefully designed trajectories and observations. Second, a SLAM baseline is proposed using our dataset to evaluate widely used modules in camera pose tracking, parametrization, and optimization modules. By evaluating these state-of-the-art algorithms across different scenarios, we discern each module's strengths and weaknesses within the camera tracking and optimization process.

|**2023-10-12**|**Jointly Optimized Global-Local Visual Localization of UAVs**|Navigation and localization of UAVs present a challenge when global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are disrupted and unreliable. Traditional techniques, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and visual odometry (VO), exhibit certain limitations in furnishing absolute coordinates and mitigating error accumulation. Existing visual localization methods achieve autonomous visual localization without error accumulation by matching with ortho satellite images. However, doing so cannot guarantee real-time performance due to the complex matching process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Global-Local Visual Localization (GLVL) network. Our GLVL network is a two-stage visual localization approach, combining a large-scale retrieval module that finds similar regions with the UAV flight scene, and a fine-grained matching module that localizes the precise UAV coordinate, enabling real-time and precise localization. The training process is jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner to further enhance the model capability. Experiments on six UAV flight scenes encompassing both texture-rich and texture-sparse regions demonstrate the ability of our model to achieve the real-time precise localization requirements of UAVs. Particularly, our method achieves a localization error of only 2.39 meters in 0.48 seconds in a village scene with sparse texture features. et.al.|[2310.08082](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08082)|null|
|**2023-10-10**|**l-dyno: framework to learn consistent visual features using robot's motion**|Historically, feature-based approaches have been used extensively for camera-based robot perception tasks such as localization, mapping, tracking, and others. Several of these approaches also combine other sensors (inertial sensing, for example) to perform combined state estimation. Our work rethinks this approach; we present a representation learning mechanism that identifies visual features that best correspond to robot motion as estimated by an external signal. Specifically, we utilize the robot's transformations through an external signal (inertial sensing, for example) and give attention to image space that is most consistent with the external signal. We use a pairwise consistency metric as a representation to keep the visual features consistent through a sequence with the robot's relative pose transformations. This approach enables us to incorporate information from the robot's perspective instead of solely relying on the image attributes. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets such as KITTI & EuRoC and compare the refined features with existing feature descriptors. We also evaluate our method using our real robot experiment. We notice an average of 49% reduction in the image search space without compromising the trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method reduces the execution time of visual odometry by 4.3% and also reduces reprojection errors. We demonstrate the need to select only the most important features and show the competitiveness using various feature detection baselines. et.al.|[2310.06249](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06249)|null|

The recent emergence of neural implicit representations has introduced radical innovation to this field as implicit representations enable numerous capabilities. Among these, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has sparked a trend because of the huge representational advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, compact environment storage, and continuous scene representations. Apart from computer vision, NeRF has also shown tremendous potential in the field of robotics. Thus, we create this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRF in the field of robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF, as well as its current applications and future potential, we hope to shed light on this promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections: \textit{The Application of NeRF in Robotics} and \textit{The Advance of NeRF in Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could be used in the field of robotics from the perception and interaction perspectives. In the second section, we show some works related to improving NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRF in the field of robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing challenges and provide some valuable future research directions for reference. et.al.|[2405.01333](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01333)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**DiL-NeRF: Delving into Lidar for Neural Radiance Field on Street Scenes**|Photorealistic simulation plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous driving, where advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) may allow better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets. However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes. et.al.|[2405.00900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00900)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Depth Priors in Removal Neural Radiance Fields**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results in 3D reconstruction and generating novel views. A key challenge within NeRF is the editing of reconstructed scenes, such as object removal, which requires maintaining consistency across multiple views and ensuring high-quality synthesised perspectives. Previous studies have incorporated depth priors, typically from LiDAR or sparse depth measurements provided by COLMAP, to improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular depth estimation methods into the removal NeRF model, i.e., SpinNeRF, to assess their capacity to improve object removal performance. Our experimental results highlight the potential of monocular depth estimation to substantially improve NeRF applications. et.al.|[2405.00630](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00630)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**NeRF-Guided Unsupervised Learning of RGB-D Registration**|This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration. Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field (NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model. Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset, Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper reproduction. et.al.|[2405.00507](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00507)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**RTG-SLAM: Real-time 3D Reconstruction at Scale using Gaussian Splatting**|We present Real-time Gaussian SLAM (RTG-SLAM), a real-time 3D reconstruction system with an RGBD camera for large-scale environments using Gaussian splatting. The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy. et.al.|[2404.19706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19706)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**NeRF-Insert: 3D Local Editing with Multimodal Control Signals**|We propose NeRF-Insert, a NeRF editing framework that allows users to make high-quality local edits with a flexible level of control. Unlike previous work that relied on image-to-image models, we cast scene editing as an in-painting problem, which encourages the global structure of the scene to be preserved. Moreover, while most existing methods use only textual prompts to condition edits, our framework accepts a combination of inputs of different modalities as reference. More precisely, a user may provide a combination of textual and visual inputs including images, CAD models, and binary image masks for specifying a 3D region. We use generic image generation models to in-paint the scene from multiple viewpoints, and lift the local edits to a 3D-consistent NeRF edit. Compared to previous methods, our results show better visual quality and also maintain stronger consistency with the original NeRF. et.al.|[2404.19204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19204)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**SAGS: Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting**|Following the advent of NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has paved the way to real-time neural rendering overcoming the computational burden of volumetric methods. Following the pioneering work of 3D-GS, several methods have attempted to achieve compressible and high-fidelity performance alternatives. However, by employing a geometry-agnostic optimization scheme, these methods neglect the inherent 3D structure of the scene, thereby restricting the expressivity and the quality of the representation, resulting in various floating points and artifacts. In this work, we propose a structure-aware Gaussian Splatting method (SAGS) that implicitly encodes the geometry of the scene, which reflects to state-of-the-art rendering performance and reduced storage requirements on benchmark novel-view synthesis datasets. SAGS is founded on a local-global graph representation that facilitates the learning of complex scenes and enforces meaningful point displacements that preserve the scene's geometry. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight version of SAGS, using a simple yet effective mid-point interpolation scheme, which showcases a compact representation of the scene with up to 24 $\times$ size reduction without the reliance on any compression strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SAGS compared to state-of-the-art 3D-GS methods under both rendering quality and model size. Besides, we demonstrate that our structure-aware method can effectively mitigate floating artifacts and irregular distortions of previous methods while obtaining precise depth maps.

|**2024-04-29**|**GSTalker: Real-time Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation via Deformable Gaussian Splatting**|We present GStalker, a 3D audio-driven talking face generation model with Gaussian Splatting for both fast training (40 minutes) and real-time rendering (125 FPS) with a 3 $\sim$ 5 minute video for training material, in comparison with previous 2D and 3D NeRF-based modeling frameworks which require hours of training and seconds of rendering per frame. Specifically, GSTalker learns an audio-driven Gaussian deformation field to translate and transform 3D Gaussians to synchronize with audio information, in which multi-resolution hashing grid-based tri-plane and temporal smooth module are incorporated to learn accurate deformation for fine-grained facial details. In addition, a pose-conditioned deformation field is designed to model the stabilized torso. To enable efficient optimization of the condition Gaussian deformation field, we initialize 3D Gaussians by learning a coarse static Gaussian representation. Extensive experiments in person-specific videos with audio tracks validate that GSTalker can generate high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized results with fast training and real-time rendering speed. et.al.|[2404.19040](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19040)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Embedded Representation Learning Network for Animating Styled Video Portrait**|The talking head generation recently attracted considerable attention due to its widespread application prospects, especially for digital avatars and 3D animation design. Inspired by this practical demand, several works explored Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to synthesize the talking heads. However, these methods based on NeRF face two challenges: (1) Difficulty in generating style-controllable talking heads. (2) Displacement artifacts around the neck in rendered images. To overcome these two challenges, we propose a novel generative paradigm \textit{Embedded Representation Learning Network} (ERLNet) with two learning stages. First, the \textit{ audio-driven FLAME} (ADF) module is constructed to produce facial expression and head pose sequences synchronized with content audio and style video. Second, given the sequence deduced by the ADF, one novel \textit{dual-branch fusion NeRF} (DBF-NeRF) explores these contents to render the final images. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that the collaboration of these two stages effectively facilitates our method to render a more realistic talking head than the existing algorithms. et.al.|[2404.19038](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19038)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Simple-RF: Regularizing Sparse Input Radiance Fields with Simpler Solutions**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) show impressive performance in photo-realistic free-view rendering of scenes. Recent improvements on the NeRF such as TensoRF and ZipNeRF employ explicit models for faster optimization and rendering, as compared to the NeRF that employs an implicit representation. However, both implicit and explicit radiance fields require dense sampling of images in the given scene. Their performance degrades significantly when only a sparse set of views is available. Researchers find that supervising the depth estimated by a radiance field helps train it effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along with the main radiance field. Further, we aim to design a framework of regularizations that can work across different implicit and explicit radiance fields. We observe that certain features of these radiance field models overfit to the observed images in the sparse-input scenario. Our key finding is that reducing the capability of the radiance fields with respect to positional encoding, the number of decomposed tensor components or the size of the hash table, constrains the model to learn simpler solutions, which estimate better depth in certain regions. By designing augmented models based on such reduced capabilities, we obtain better depth supervision for the main radiance field. We achieve state-of-the-art view-synthesis performance with sparse input views on popular datasets containing forward-facing and 360 $^\circ$ scenes by employing the above regularizations. et.al.|[2404.19015](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19015)|null|
|**2024-04-28**|**S3-SLAM: Sparse Tri-plane Encoding for Neural Implicit SLAM**|With the emergence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), neural implicit representations have gained widespread applications across various domains, including simultaneous localization and mapping. However, current neural implicit SLAM faces a challenging trade-off problem between performance and the number of parameters. To address this problem, we propose sparse tri-plane encoding, which efficiently achieves scene reconstruction at resolutions up to 512 using only 2~4% of the commonly used tri-plane parameters (reduced from 100MB to 2~4MB). On this basis, we design S3-SLAM to achieve rapid and high-quality tracking and mapping through sparsifying plane parameters and integrating orthogonal features of tri-plane. Furthermore, we develop hierarchical bundle adjustment to achieve globally consistent geometric structures and reconstruct high-resolution appearance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive tracking and scene reconstruction with minimal parameters on three datasets. Source code will soon be available. et.al.|[2404.18284](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18284)|null|
|**2024-04-27**|**DPER: Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation for Limited Angle and Sparse View CT Reconstruction**|Limited-angle and sparse-view computed tomography (LACT and SVCT) are crucial for expanding the scope of X-ray CT applications. However, they face challenges due to incomplete data acquisition, resulting in diverse artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR) techniques, such as NeRF, NeAT, and NeRP, have shown promise in under-determined CT imaging reconstruction tasks. However, the unsupervised nature of INR architecture imposes limited constraints on the solution space, particularly for the highly ill-posed reconstruction task posed by LACT and ultra-SVCT. In this study, we introduce the Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation (DPER), an advanced unsupervised framework designed to address the exceptionally ill-posed CT reconstruction inverse problems. DPER adopts the Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to decompose the inverse problem into data fidelity and distribution prior sub-problems. The two sub-problems are respectively addressed by INR reconstruction scheme and pre-trained score-based diffusion model. This combination initially preserves the implicit image local consistency prior from INR. Additionally, it effectively augments the feasibility of the solution space for the inverse problem through the generative diffusion model, resulting in increased stability and precision in the solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of DPER on LACT and ultra-SVCT reconstruction with two public datasets (AAPM and LIDC). The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods on in-domain datasets, while achieving significant performance improvements on out-of-domain datasets. et.al.|[2404.17890](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17890)|null|
|**2024-04-26**|**Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering for Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields**|Generalizable NeRF aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes. Common practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However, existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions due to inaccurate geometry, sub-optimal descriptors, and decoding strategies. We address these issues point by point. First, we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors, our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When decoding the descriptors, we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel in different areas, which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF) strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both. We incorporate the above ACA, SVA, and CAF into a coarse-to-fine framework, termed Geometry-aware Reconstruction and Fusion-refined Rendering (GeFu). GeFu attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/TQTQliu/GeFu . et.al.|[2404.17528](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17528)|**[link](https://github.com/tqtqliu/gefu)**|
|**2024-04-25**|**Depth Supervised Neural Surface Reconstruction from Airborne Imagery**|While originally developed for novel view synthesis, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently emerged as an alternative to multi-view stereo (MVS). Triggered by a manifold of research activities, promising results have been gained especially for texture-less, transparent, and reflecting surfaces, while such scenarios remain challenging for traditional MVS-based approaches. However, most of these investigations focus on close-range scenarios, with studies for airborne scenarios still missing. For this task, NeRFs face potential difficulties at areas of low image redundancy and weak data evidence, as often found in street canyons, facades or building shadows. Furthermore, training such networks is computationally expensive. Thus, the aim of our work is twofold: First, we investigate the applicability of NeRFs for aerial image blocks representing different characteristics like nadir-only, oblique and high-resolution imagery. Second, during these investigations we demonstrate the benefit of integrating depth priors from tie-point measures, which are provided during presupposed Bundle Block Adjustment. Our work is based on the state-of-the-art framework VolSDF, which models 3D scenes by signed distance functions (SDFs), since this is more applicable for surface reconstruction compared to the standard volumetric representation in vanilla NeRFs. For evaluation, the NeRF-based reconstructions are compared to results of a publicly available benchmark dataset for airborne images. et.al.|[2404.16429](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16429)|null|
|**2024-04-24**|**NeRF-XL: Scaling NeRFs with Multiple GPUs**|We present NeRF-XL, a principled method for distributing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) across multiple GPUs, thus enabling the training and rendering of NeRFs with an arbitrarily large capacity. We begin by revisiting existing multi-GPU approaches, which decompose large scenes into multiple independently trained NeRFs, and identify several fundamental issues with these methods that hinder improvements in reconstruction quality as additional computational resources (GPUs) are used in training. NeRF-XL remedies these issues and enables the training and rendering of NeRFs with an arbitrary number of parameters by simply using more hardware. At the core of our method lies a novel distributed training and rendering formulation, which is mathematically equivalent to the classic single-GPU case and minimizes communication between GPUs. By unlocking NeRFs with arbitrarily large parameter counts, our approach is the first to reveal multi-GPU scaling laws for NeRFs, showing improvements in reconstruction quality with larger parameter counts and speed improvements with more GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRF-XL on a wide variety of datasets, including the largest open-source dataset to date, MatrixCity, containing 258K images covering a 25km^2 city area. et.al.|[2404.16221](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16221)|null|
|**2024-04-24**|**ESR-NeRF: Emissive Source Reconstruction Using LDR Multi-view Images**|Existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods suppose that scenes are exclusively illuminated by distant light sources, neglecting the potential influence of emissive sources within a scene. In this work, we confront this limitation using LDR multi-view images captured with emissive sources turned on and off. Two key issues must be addressed: 1) ambiguity arising from the limited dynamic range along with unknown lighting details, and 2) the expensive computational cost in volume rendering to backtrace the paths leading to final object colors. We present a novel approach, ESR-NeRF, leveraging neural networks as learnable functions to represent ray-traced fields. By training networks to satisfy light transport segments, we regulate outgoing radiances, progressively identifying emissive sources while being aware of reflection areas. The results on scenes encompassing emissive sources with various properties demonstrate the superiority of ESR-NeRF in qualitative and quantitative ways. Our approach also extends its applicability to the scenes devoid of emissive sources, achieving lower CD metrics on the DTU dataset. et.al.|[2404.15707](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15707)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**DreamCraft: Text-Guided Generation of Functional 3D Environments in Minecraft**|Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms enable the automatic generation of complex and diverse artifacts. However, they don't provide high-level control over the generated content and typically require domain expertise. In contrast, text-to-3D methods allow users to specify desired characteristics in natural language, offering a high amount of flexibility and expressivity. But unlike PCG, such approaches cannot guarantee functionality, which is crucial for certain applications like game design. In this paper, we present a method for generating functional 3D artifacts from free-form text prompts in the open-world game Minecraft. Our method, DreamCraft, trains quantized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to represent artifacts that, when viewed in-game, match given text descriptions. We find that DreamCraft produces more aligned in-game artifacts than a baseline that post-processes the output of an unconstrained NeRF. Thanks to the quantized representation of the environment, functional constraints can be integrated using specialized loss terms. We show how this can be leveraged to generate 3D structures that match a target distribution or obey certain adjacency rules over the block types. DreamCraft inherits a high degree of expressivity and controllability from the NeRF, while still being able to incorporate functional constraints through domain-specific objectives. et.al.|[2404.15538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15538)|null|
|**2024-04-28**|**GaussianTalker: Speaker-specific Talking Head Synthesis via 3D Gaussian Splatting**|Recent works on audio-driven talking head synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose and expression control caused by NeRF implicit representation, these methods still have some limitations, such as unsynchronized or unnatural lip movements, and visual jitter and artifacts. In this paper, we propose GaussianTalker, a novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation. Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis, delivering precise lip synchronization and exceptional visual quality. Our method achieves rendering speeds of 130 FPS on NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU, significantly exceeding the threshold for real-time rendering performance, and can potentially be deployed on other hardware platforms. et.al.|[2404.14037](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14037)|null|
|**2024-04-22**|**NeRF-DetS: Enhancing Multi-View 3D Object Detection with Sampling-adaptive Network of Continuous NeRF-based Representation**|As a preliminary work, NeRF-Det unifies the tasks of novel view synthesis and 3D perception, demonstrating that perceptual tasks can benefit from novel view synthesis methods like NeRF, significantly improving the performance of indoor multi-view 3D object detection. Using the geometry MLP of NeRF to direct the attention of detection head to crucial parts and incorporating self-supervised loss from novel view rendering contribute to the achieved improvement. To better leverage the notable advantages of the continuous representation through neural rendering in space, we introduce a novel 3D perception network structure, NeRF-DetS. The key component of NeRF-DetS is the Multi-level Sampling-Adaptive Network, making the sampling process adaptively from coarse to fine. Also, we propose a superior multi-view information fusion method, known as Multi-head Weighted Fusion. This fusion approach efficiently addresses the challenge of losing multi-view information when using arithmetic mean, while keeping low computational costs. NeRF-DetS outperforms competitive NeRF-Det on the ScanNetV2 dataset, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP@.25 and mAP@.50, respectively. et.al.|[2404.13921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13921)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**CT-NeRF: Incremental Optimizing Neural Radiance Field and Poses with Complex Trajectory**|Neural radiance field (NeRF) has achieved impressive results in high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses. While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations. To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation accuracy. et.al.|[2404.13896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13896)|null|
|**2024-04-26**|**Neural Radiance Field in Autonomous Driving: A Survey**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to its intrinsic advantages, particularly its implicit representation and novel view synthesis capabilities. With the rapid advancements in deep learning, a multitude of methods have emerged to explore the potential applications of NeRF in the domain of Autonomous Driving (AD). However, a conspicuous void is apparent within the current literature. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of NeRF's applications in the context of AD. Our survey is structured to categorize NeRF's applications in Autonomous Driving (AD), specifically encompassing perception, 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and simulation. We delve into in-depth analysis and summarize the findings for each application category, and conclude by providing insights and discussions on future directions in this field. We hope this paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers in this domain.

|**2024-04-26**|**ArtNeRF: A Stylized Neural Field for 3D-Aware Cartoonized Face Synthesis**|Recent advances in generative visual models and neural radiance fields have greatly boosted 3D-aware image synthesis and stylization tasks. However, previous NeRF-based work is limited to single scene stylization, training a model to generate 3D-aware cartoon faces with arbitrary styles remains unsolved. We propose ArtNeRF, a novel face stylization framework derived from 3D-aware GAN to tackle this problem. In this framework, we utilize an expressive generator to synthesize stylized faces and a triple-branch discriminator module to improve the visual quality and style consistency of the generated faces. Specifically, a style encoder based on contrastive learning is leveraged to extract robust low-dimensional embeddings of style images, empowering the generator with the knowledge of various styles. To smooth the training process of cross-domain transfer learning, we propose an adaptive style blending module which helps inject style information and allows users to freely tune the level of stylization.

|**2024-04-21**|**Generalizable Novel-View Synthesis using a Stereo Camera**|In this paper, we propose the first generalizable view synthesis approach that specifically targets multi-view stereo-camera images. Since recent stereo matching has demonstrated accurate geometry prediction, we introduce stereo matching into novel-view synthesis for high-quality geometry reconstruction. To this end, this paper proposes a novel framework, dubbed StereoNeRF, which integrates stereo matching into a NeRF-based generalizable view synthesis approach. StereoNeRF is equipped with three key components to effectively exploit stereo matching in novel-view synthesis: a stereo feature extractor, a depth-guided plane-sweeping, and a stereo depth loss. Moreover, we propose the StereoNVS dataset, the first multi-view dataset of stereo-camera images, encompassing a wide variety of both real and synthetic scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that StereoNeRF surpasses previous approaches in generalizable view synthesis. et.al.|[2404.13541](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13541)|null|
|**2024-04-20**|**High-fidelity Endoscopic Image Synthesis by Utilizing Depth-guided Neural Surfaces**|In surgical oncology, screening colonoscopy plays a pivotal role in providing diagnostic assistance, such as biopsy, and facilitating surgical navigation, particularly in polyp detection. Computer-assisted endoscopic surgery has recently gained attention and amalgamated various 3D computer vision techniques, including camera localization, depth estimation, surface reconstruction, etc. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Neural Implicit Surfaces (NeuS) have emerged as promising methodologies for deriving accurate 3D surface models from sets of registered images, addressing the limitations of existing colon reconstruction approaches stemming from constrained camera movement.   However, the inadequate tissue texture representation and confused scale problem in monocular colonoscopic image reconstruction still impede the progress of the final rendering results. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for colon section reconstruction by leveraging NeuS applied to endoscopic images, supplemented by a single frame of depth map. Notably, we pioneered the exploration of utilizing only one frame depth map in photorealistic reconstruction and neural rendering applications while this single depth map can be easily obtainable from other monocular depth estimation networks with an object scale. Through rigorous experimentation and validation on phantom imagery, our approach demonstrates exceptional accuracy in completely rendering colon sections, even capturing unseen portions of the surface. This breakthrough opens avenues for achieving stable and consistently scaled reconstructions, promising enhanced quality in cancer screening procedures and treatment interventions. et.al.|[2404.13437](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13437)|null|

Although recent NeRF-based SLAM systems have demonstrated encouraging outcomes, they have yet to completely leverage NeRF's capability to constrain pose optimization. By employing an effectively constrained global bundle adjustment (BA) strategy, our system makes use of NeRF's implicit loop closure correction capability. This improves the tracking accuracy by reinforcing the constraints on the keyframes that are most pertinent to the optimized current frame. In addition, by implementing a feature-based and uniform sampling strategy that minimizes the number of ineffective constraint points for pose optimization, we mitigate the effects of random sampling in NeRF. EC-SLAM utilizes sparse parametric encodings and the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) to represent the map in order to facilitate efficient fusion, resulting in reduced model parameters and accelerated convergence velocity. A comprehensive evaluation conducted on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM datasets showcases cutting-edge performance, including enhanced reconstruction accuracy resulting from precise pose estimation, 21 Hz run time, and tracking precision improvements of up to 50\%.

In response to this issue, our study introduces FlyNeRF, a system integrating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with drone-based data acquisition for high-quality 3D reconstruction. Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for capturing images and corresponding spatial coordinates, the obtained data is subsequently used for the initial NeRF-based 3D reconstruction of the environment. Further evaluation of the reconstruction render quality is accomplished by the image evaluation neural network developed within the scope of our system. According to the results of the image evaluation module, an autonomous algorithm determines the position for additional image capture, thereby improving the reconstruction quality. The neural network introduced for render quality assessment demonstrates an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, our adaptive methodology enhances the overall reconstruction quality, resulting in an average improvement of 2.5 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for the 10% quantile.

Despite its advantages, Gaussian Splatting's reliance on high-quality point cloud initialization by Structure-from-Motion (SFM) algorithms is a significant limitation to be overcome. To this end, we investigate various initialization strategies for Gaussian Splatting and delve into how volumetric reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be utilized to bypass the dependency on SFM data. Our findings demonstrate that random initialization can perform much better if carefully designed and that by employing a combination of improved initialization strategies and structure distillation from low-cost NeRF models, it is possible to achieve equivalent results, or at times even superior, to those obtained from SFM initialization. et.al.|[2404.12547](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12547)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**MeshLRM: Large Reconstruction Model for High-Quality Mesh**|We propose MeshLRM, a novel LRM-based approach that can reconstruct a high-quality mesh from merely four input images in less than one second. Different from previous large reconstruction models (LRMs) that focus on NeRF-based reconstruction, MeshLRM incorporates differentiable mesh extraction and rendering within the LRM framework. This allows for end-to-end mesh reconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering. Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complex designs in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trained with low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enables significantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with less compute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction from sparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, including text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation.

|**2024-04-18**|**AG-NeRF: Attention-guided Neural Radiance Fields for Multi-height Large-scale Outdoor Scene Rendering**|Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF)-based novel view synthesis methods for large-scale outdoor scenes are mainly built on a single altitude. Moreover, they often require a priori camera shooting height and scene scope, leading to inefficient and impractical applications when camera altitude changes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed AG-NeRF, and seek to reduce the training cost of building good reconstructions by synthesizing free-viewpoint images based on varying altitudes of scenes. Specifically, to tackle the detail variation problem from low altitude (drone-level) to high altitude (satellite-level), a source image selection method and an attention-based feature fusion approach are developed to extract and fuse the most relevant features of target view from multi-height images for high-fidelity rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AG-NeRF achieves SOTA performance on 56 Leonard and Transamerica benchmarks and only requires a half hour of training time to reach the competitive PSNR as compared to the latest BungeeNeRF. et.al.|[2404.11897](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11897)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**Cicero: Addressing Algorithmic and Architectural Bottlenecks in Neural Rendering by Radiance Warping and Memory Optimizations**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is widely seen as an alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. However, NeRF has not yet seen its adoption in resource-limited mobile systems such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), because it is simply extremely slow. On a mobile Volta GPU, even the state-of-the-art NeRF models generally execute only at 0.8 FPS. We show that the main performance bottlenecks are both algorithmic and architectural. We introduce, CICERO, to tame both forms of inefficiencies. We first introduce two algorithms, one fundamentally reduces the amount of work any NeRF model has to execute, and the other eliminates irregular DRAM accesses. We then describe an on-chip data layout strategy that eliminates SRAM bank conflicts. A pure software implementation of CICERO offers an 8.0x speed-up and 7.9x energy saving over a mobile Volta GPU. When compared to a baseline with a dedicated DNN accelerator, our speed-up and energy reduction increase to 28.2x and 37.8x, respectively - all with minimal quality loss (less than 1.0 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction). et.al.|[2404.11852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11852)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**SLAIM: Robust Dense Neural SLAM for Online Tracking and Mapping**|We present SLAIM - Simultaneous Localization and Implicit Mapping. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine tracking model tailored for Neural Radiance Field SLAM (NeRF-SLAM) to achieve state-of-the-art tracking performance. Notably, existing NeRF-SLAM systems consistently exhibit inferior tracking performance compared to traditional SLAM algorithms. NeRF-SLAM methods solve camera tracking via image alignment and photometric bundle-adjustment. Such optimization processes are difficult to optimize due to the narrow basin of attraction of the optimization loss in image space (local minima) and the lack of initial correspondences. We mitigate these limitations by implementing a Gaussian pyramid filter on top of NeRF, facilitating a coarse-to-fine tracking optimization strategy. Furthermore, NeRF systems encounter challenges in converging to the right geometry with limited input views. While prior approaches use a Signed-Distance Function (SDF)-based NeRF and directly supervise SDF values by approximating ground truth SDF through depth measurements, this often results in suboptimal geometry. In contrast, our method employs a volume density representation and introduces a novel KL regularizer on the ray termination distribution, constraining scene geometry to consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. Our solution implements both local and global bundle-adjustment to produce a robust (coarse-to-fine) and accurate (KL regularizer) SLAM solution. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets (ScanNet, TUM, Replica) showing state-of-the-art results in tracking and in reconstruction accuracy. et.al.|[2404.11419](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11419)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**Gaussian Splatting Decoder for 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks**|NeRF-based 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like EG3D or GIRAFFE have shown very high rendering quality under large representational variety. However, rendering with Neural Radiance Fields poses challenges for 3D applications: First, the significant computational demands of NeRF rendering preclude its use on low-power devices, such as mobiles and VR/AR headsets. Second, implicit representations based on neural networks are difficult to incorporate into explicit 3D scenes, such as VR environments or video games. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes these limitations by providing an explicit 3D representation that can be rendered efficiently at high frame rates. In this work, we present a novel approach that combines the high rendering quality of NeRF-based 3D-aware GANs with the flexibility and computational advantages of 3DGS. By training a decoder that maps implicit NeRF representations to explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting attributes, we can integrate the representational diversity and quality of 3D GANs into the ecosystem of 3D Gaussian Splatting for the first time. Additionally, our approach allows for a high resolution GAN inversion and real-time GAN editing with 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. et.al.|[2404.10625](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10625)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**Enhancing 3D Fidelity of Text-to-3D using Cross-View Correspondences**|Leveraging multi-view diffusion models as priors for 3D optimization have alleviated the problem of 3D consistency, e.g., the Janus face problem or the content drift problem, in zero-shot text-to-3D models. However, the 3D geometric fidelity of the output remains an unresolved issue; albeit the rendered 2D views are realistic, the underlying geometry may contain errors such as unreasonable concavities. In this work, we propose CorrespondentDream, an effective method to leverage annotation-free, cross-view correspondences yielded from the diffusion U-Net to provide additional 3D prior to the NeRF optimization process. We find that these correspondences are strongly consistent with human perception, and by adopting it in our loss design, we are able to produce NeRF models with geometries that are more coherent with common sense, e.g., more smoothed object surface, yielding higher 3D fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through various comparative qualitative results and a solid user study. et.al.|[2404.10603](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10603)|null|

|**2024-04-16**|**SRGS: Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting**|Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity as a novel explicit 3D representation. This approach relies on the representation power of Gaussian primitives to provide a high-quality rendering. However, primitives optimized at low resolution inevitably exhibit sparsity and texture deficiency, posing a challenge for achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (SRGS) to perform the optimization in a high-resolution (HR) space. The sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space, exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution (LR) views. The gradient accumulated from more viewpoints will facilitate the densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution model is integrated with the sub-pixel constraint, enabling these dense primitives to learn faithful texture features. In general, our method focuses on densification and texture learning to effectively enhance the representation ability of primitives. Experimentally, our method achieves high rendering quality on HRNVS only with LR inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples. Related codes will be released upon acceptance. et.al.|[2404.10318](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10318)|null|

However, OG manages occupied regions in the form of the dense binary grid, in which there are many blocks with the same values that cause redundant examination of voxels' emptiness in ray-tracing. In our work, we introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of ray-tracing in trained OG without fine-tuning. First, we replace the dense grids with VDB grids to reduce the spatial redundancy. Second, we use hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) to efficiently trace voxels in the VDB grids. Our experiments on NeRF-Synthetic and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets show that our proposed method successfully accelerates rendering NeRF-Synthetic dataset by 12% in average and Mip-NeRF 360 dataset by 4% in average, compared to a fast implementation of OG, NerfAcc, without losing the quality of rendered images. et.al.|[2404.10272](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10272)|**[link](https://github.com/yosshi999/faster-occgrid)**|
|**2024-04-15**|**Taming Latent Diffusion Model for Neural Radiance Field Inpainting**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a representation for 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Despite some recent work showing preliminary success in editing a reconstructed NeRF with diffusion prior, they remain struggling to synthesize reasonable geometry in completely uncovered regions. One major reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model, which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors. These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model's stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift with masked adversarial training. During the analyses, we also found the commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting task. Through rigorous experiments, our framework yields state-of-the-art NeRF inpainting results on various real-world scenes.

In this paper, we present Video2Game, a novel approach that automatically converts videos of real-world scenes into realistic and interactive game environments. At the heart of our system are three core components:(i) a neural radiance fields (NeRF) module that effectively captures the geometry and visual appearance of the scene; (ii) a mesh module that distills the knowledge from NeRF for faster rendering; and (iii) a physics module that models the interactions and physical dynamics among the objects. By following the carefully designed pipeline, one can construct an interactable and actionable digital replica of the real world.

|**2024-04-15**|**DeferredGS: Decoupled and Editable Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Shading**|Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and editing tasks. et.al.|[2404.09412](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09412)|null|
|**2024-04-14**|**VRS-NeRF: Visual Relocalization with Sparse Neural Radiance Field**|Visual relocalization is a key technique to autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality. After decades of explorations, absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and hierarchical methods (HMs) have become the most popular frameworks. However, in spite of high efficiency, APRs and SCRs have limited accuracy especially in large-scale outdoor scenes; HMs are accurate but need to store a large number of 2D descriptors for matching, resulting in poor efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate framework, called VRS-NeRF, for visual relocalization with sparse neural radiance field. Precisely, we introduce an explicit geometric map (EGM) for 3D map representation and an implicit learning map (ILM) for sparse patches rendering. In this localization process, EGP provides priors of spare 2D points and ILM utilizes these sparse points to render patches with sparse NeRFs for matching. This allows us to discard a large number of 2D descriptors so as to reduce the map size. Moreover, rendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole image reduces the rendering time significantly. This framework inherits the accuracy of HMs and discards their low efficiency. Experiments on 7Scenes, CambridgeLandmarks, and Aachen datasets show that our method gives much better accuracy than APRs and SCRs, and close performance to HMs but is much more efficient. et.al.|[2404.09271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09271)|**[link](https://github.com/feixue94/vrs-nerf)**|

Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.

|**2024-04-12**|**GPN: Generative Point-based NeRF**|Scanning real-life scenes with modern registration devices typically gives incomplete point cloud representations, primarily due to the limitations of partial scanning, 3D occlusions, and dynamic light conditions. Recent works on processing incomplete point clouds have always focused on point cloud completion. However, these approaches do not ensure consistency between the completed point cloud and the captured images regarding color and geometry. We propose using Generative Point-based NeRF (GPN) to reconstruct and repair a partial cloud by fully utilizing the scanning images and the corresponding reconstructed cloud. The repaired point cloud can achieve multi-view consistency with the captured images at high spatial resolution. For the finetunes of a single scene, we optimize the global latent condition by incorporating an Auto-Decoder architecture while retaining multi-view consistency. As a result, the generated point clouds are smooth, plausible, and geometrically consistent with the partial scanning images. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that our works achieve competitive performances to the other state-of-the-art point cloud-based neural scene rendering and editing performances. et.al.|[2404.08312](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08312)|**[link](https://github.com/forestsen/GPN)**|

In this paper, we aim to create 3D models that provide accurate geometry and view synthesis, partially closing the large geometric performance gap between NeRF and traditional MVS methods. We propose a patch-based approach that effectively leverages monocular surface normal and relative depth predictions. The patch-based ray sampling also enables the appearance regularization of normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and structural similarity (SSIM) between randomly sampled virtual and training views. We further show that "density restrictions" based on sparse structure-from-motion points can help greatly improve geometric accuracy with a slight drop in novel view synthesis metrics.

While classical approaches and, more recently, depth map predictions only focus on the visible parts of a scene, the task of scene completion aims to reason about geometry even in occluded regions. With the popularity of neural radiance fields (NeRFs), implicit representations also became popular for scene completion by predicting so-called density fields. Unlike explicit approaches. e.g. voxel-based methods, density fields also allow for accurate depth prediction and novel-view synthesis via image-based rendering. In this work, we propose to fuse the scene reconstruction from multiple images and distill this knowledge into a more accurate single-view scene reconstruction. To this end, we propose Multi-View Behind the Scenes (MVBTS) to fuse density fields from multiple posed images, trained fully self-supervised only from image data. Using knowledge distillation, we use MVBTS to train a single-view scene completion network via direct supervision called KDBTS.

In this work, we use our simulator to test the responses of AD models to safety-critical scenarios inspired by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).

|**2024-04-11**|**G-NeRF: Geometry-enhanced Novel View Synthesis from Single-View Images**|Novel view synthesis aims to generate new view images of a given view image collection. Recent attempts address this problem relying on 3D geometry priors (e.g., shapes, sizes, and positions) learned from multi-view images. However, such methods encounter the following limitations: 1) they require a set of multi-view images as training data for a specific scene (e.g., face, car or chair), which is often unavailable in many real-world scenarios; 2) they fail to extract the geometry priors from single-view images due to the lack of multi-view supervision. In this paper, we propose a Geometry-enhanced NeRF (G-NeRF), which seeks to enhance the geometry priors by a geometry-guided multi-view synthesis approach, followed by a depth-aware training. In the synthesis process, inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally synthesize high-fidelity multi-view images, we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D GAN models, such as EG3D, as a free source to provide geometry priors through synthesizing multi-view data. Simultaneously, to further improve the geometry quality of the synthetic data, we introduce a truncation method to effectively sample latent codes within 3D GAN models. To tackle the absence of multi-view supervision for single-view images, we design the depth-aware training approach, incorporating a depth-aware discriminator to guide geometry priors through depth maps.

However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set. et.al.|[2404.06832](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06832)|**[link](https://github.com/m-kruse98/splatpose)**|

We propose a novel framework - MonoSelfRecon that for the first time achieves explicit 3D mesh reconstruction for generalizable indoor scenes with monocular RGB views by purely self-supervision on voxel-SDF (signed distance function). MonoSelfRecon follows an Autoencoder-based architecture, decodes voxel-SDF and a generalizable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is used to guide voxel-SDF in self-supervision. We propose novel self-supervised losses, which not only support pure self-supervision, but can be used together with supervised signals to further boost supervised training. Our experiments show that "MonoSelfRecon" trained in pure self-supervision outperforms current best self-supervised indoor depth estimation models and is comparable to 3DR models trained in fully supervision with depth annotations. MonoSelfRecon is not restricted by specific model design, which can be used to any models with voxel-SDF for purely self-supervised manner. et.al.|[2404.06753](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06753)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density in Neural Radiance Fields**|We present the Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in geometric volume structures without the need for additional networks, making it adept for challenging observations and uncontrolled images. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by offering an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in relaxing uncertainties by using geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies in interpretation under insufficient real-world observations. Recent research efforts aimed at addressing this issue have primarily relied on empirical methods or auxiliary networks. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a series of formulational extensions to NeRF. By introducing generalized approximations and defining density-related uncertainty, our method seamlessly extends to manage uncertainty not only for RGB but also for depth, without the need for additional networks or empirical assumptions. In experiments we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset, demonstrating the reliability of the Bayesian NeRF approach to quantifying uncertainty based on the geometric structure. et.al.|[2404.06727](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727)|**[link](https://github.com/lab-of-ai-and-robotics/bayesian_nerf)**|
|**2024-04-11**|**SpikeNVS: Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from Blurry Images via Spike Camera**|One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access. et.al.|[2404.06710](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06710)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**Magic-Boost: Boost 3D Generation with Mutli-View Conditioned Diffusion**|Benefiting from the rapid development of 2D diffusion models, 3D content creation has made significant progress recently. One promising solution involves the fine-tuning of pre-trained 2D diffusion models to harness their capacity for producing multi-view images, which are then lifted into accurate 3D models via methods like fast-NeRFs or large reconstruction models. However, as inconsistency still exists and limited generated resolution, the generation results of such methods still lack intricate textures and complex geometries. To solve this problem, we propose Magic-Boost, a multi-view conditioned diffusion model that significantly refines coarse generative results through a brief period of SDS optimization ( $\sim15$ min). Compared to the previous text or single image based diffusion models, Magic-Boost exhibits a robust capability to generate images with high consistency from pseudo synthesized multi-view images. It provides precise SDS guidance that well aligns with the identity of the input images, enriching the local detail in both geometry and texture of the initial generative results. Extensive experiments show Magic-Boost greatly enhances the coarse inputs and generates high-quality 3D assets with rich geometric and textural details.

|**2024-04-09**|**3D Geometry-aware Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic View Synthesis**|In this paper, we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner, which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore, the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent, which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene, building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically, the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian, where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation, we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way, our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling, which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

However, these representations often lack crucial information on the underlying human pose and structure, which is crucial for AR/VR applications and games. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, termed GHNeRF, designed to address these limitations by learning 2D/3D joint locations of human subjects with NeRF representation. GHNeRF uses a pre-trained 2D encoder streamlined to extract essential human features from 2D images, which are then incorporated into the NeRF framework in order to encode human biomechanic features. This allows our network to simultaneously learn biomechanic features, such as joint locations, along with human geometry and texture. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art human NeRF techniques and joint estimation algorithms. Our results show that GHNeRF can achieve state-of-the-art results in near real-time. et.al.|[2404.06246](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06246)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**HFNeRF: Learning Human Biomechanic Features with Neural Radiance Fields**|In recent advancements in novel view synthesis, generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based methods applied to human subjects have shown remarkable results in generating novel views from few images. However, this generalization ability cannot capture the underlying structural features of the skeleton shared across all instances. Building upon this, we introduce HFNeRF: a novel generalizable human feature NeRF aimed at generating human biomechanic features using a pre-trained image encoder. While previous human NeRF methods have shown promising results in the generation of photorealistic virtual avatars, such methods lack underlying human structure or biomechanic features such as skeleton or joint information that are crucial for downstream applications including Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR). HFNeRF leverages 2D pre-trained foundation models toward learning human features in 3D using neural rendering, and then volume rendering towards generating 2D feature maps. We evaluate HFNeRF in the skeleton estimation task by predicting heatmaps as features. The proposed method is fully differentiable, allowing to successfully learn color, geometry, and human skeleton in a simultaneous manner. This paper presents preliminary results of HFNeRF, illustrating its potential in generating realistic virtual avatars with biomechanic features using NeRF. et.al.|[2404.06152](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06152)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Stylizing Sparse-View 3D Scenes with Hierarchical Neural Representation**|Recently, a surge of 3D style transfer methods has been proposed that leverage the scene reconstruction power of a pre-trained neural radiance field (NeRF). To successfully stylize a scene this way, one must first reconstruct a photo-realistic radiance field from collected images of the scene. However, when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this paper, we consider the stylization of sparse-view scenes in terms of disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a new optimization strategy with content strength annealing to achieve realistic stylization and better content preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve high-quality stylization of sparse-view scenes and outperforms fine-tuning-based baselines in terms of stylization quality and efficiency. et.al.|[2404.05236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05236)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**StylizedGS: Controllable Stylization for 3D Gaussian Splatting**|With the rapid development of XR, 3D generation and editing are becoming more and more important, among which, stylization is an important tool of 3D appearance editing. It can achieve consistent 3D artistic stylization given a single reference style image and thus is a user-friendly editing way. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods face efficiency issues that affect the actual user experience and the implicit nature limits its ability to transfer the geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to exert flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable, fostering an environment conducive to creative exploration. In this paper, we introduce StylizedGS, a 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. The 3DGS brings the benefits of high efficiency. We propose a GS filter to eliminate floaters in the reconstruction which affects the stylization effects before stylization. Then the nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale and regions during the stylization to possess customized capabilities. Our method can attain high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference FPS. et.al.|[2404.05220](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05220)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Semantic Flow: Learning Semantic Field of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos**|In this work, we pioneer Semantic Flow, a neural semantic representation of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. In contrast to previous NeRF methods that reconstruct dynamic scenes from the colors and volume densities of individual points, Semantic Flow learns semantics from continuous flows that contain rich 3D motion information. As there is 2D-to-3D ambiguity problem in the viewing direction when extracting 3D flow features from 2D video frames, we consider the volume densities as opacity priors that describe the contributions of flow features to the semantics on the frames. More specifically, we first learn a flow network to predict flows in the dynamic scene, and propose a flow feature aggregation module to extract flow features from video frames. Then, we propose a flow attention module to extract motion information from flow features, which is followed by a semantic network to output semantic logits of flows. We integrate the logits with volume densities in the viewing direction to supervise the flow features with semantic labels on video frames. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn from multiple dynamic scenes and supports a series of new tasks such as instance-level scene editing, semantic completions, dynamic scene tracking and semantic adaption on novel scenes.

However, several factors have impeded its further proliferation as next-generation 3D media. To establish a ubiquitous presence in everyday media formats, such as images and videos, it is imperative to devise a solution that effectively fulfills three key objectives: fast encoding and decoding time, compact model sizes, and high-quality renderings. Despite significant advancements, a comprehensive algorithm that adequately addresses all objectives has yet to be fully realized. In this work, we present CodecNeRF, a neural codec for NeRF representations, consisting of a novel encoder and decoder architecture that can generate a NeRF representation in a single forward pass. Furthermore, inspired by the recent parameter-efficient finetuning approaches, we develop a novel finetuning method to efficiently adapt the generated NeRF representations to a new test instance, leading to high-quality image renderings and compact code sizes. The proposed CodecNeRF, a newly suggested encoding-decoding-finetuning pipeline for NeRF, achieved unprecedented compression performance of more than 150x and 20x reduction in encoding time while maintaining (or improving) the image quality on widely used 3D object datasets, such as ShapeNet and Objaverse. et.al.|[2404.04913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04913)|null|

This is accomplished through the strategic utilization of object-centric camera poses characterized by significant inter-frame overlap. This paper explores a compelling, alternative utility of NeRF: the derivation of point clouds from aggregated urban landscape imagery. The transmutation of street-view data into point clouds is fraught with complexities, attributable to a nexus of interdependent variables. First, high-quality point cloud generation hinges on precise camera poses, yet many datasets suffer from inaccuracies in pose metadata. Also, the standard approach of NeRF is ill-suited for the distinct characteristics of street-view data from autonomous vehicles in vast, open settings. Autonomous vehicle cameras often record with limited overlap, leading to blurring, artifacts, and compromised pavement representation in NeRF-based point clouds. In this paper, we present NeRF2Points, a tailored NeRF variant for urban point cloud synthesis, notable for its high-quality output from RGB inputs alone. Our paper is supported by a bespoke, high-resolution 20-kilometer urban street dataset, designed for point cloud generation and evaluation. NeRF2Points adeptly navigates the inherent challenges of NeRF-based point cloud synthesis through the implementation of the following strategic innovations: (1) Integration of Weighted Iterative Geometric Optimization (WIGO) and Structure from Motion (SfM) for enhanced camera pose accuracy, elevating street-view data precision.

However, extending these techniques to edit scenes in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is complex, as editing individual 2D frames can result in inconsistencies across multiple views. Our crucial insight is that a NeRF scene's geometry can serve as a bridge to integrate these 2D edits. Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges.

Additionally, we propose mechanisms for defocus blur compensation and for addressing color in-consistencies caused by ambient light, shadows, or due to camera-related factors like varying white balancing settings. Our proposed solutions integrate in a seamless way with the 3DGS formulation while maintaining its benefits in terms of training efficiency and rendering speed.

Existing approaches utilize score distillation sampling to form the dynamic scene as dynamic NeRF or dense 3D Gaussians. However, these methods struggle to strike a balance among reference view alignment, spatio-temporal consistency, and motion fidelity under single-view conditions due to the implicit nature of NeRF or the intricate dense Gaussian motion prediction. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient, sparse-controlled video-to-4D framework named SC4D, that decouples motion and appearance to achieve superior video-to-4D generation. Moreover, we introduce Adaptive Gaussian (AG) initialization and Gaussian Alignment (GA) loss to mitigate shape degeneration issue, ensuring the fidelity of the learned motion and shape. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing methods in both quality and efficiency. In addition, facilitated by the disentangled modeling of motion and appearance of SC4D, we devise a novel application that seamlessly transfers the learned motion onto a diverse array of 4D entities according to textual descriptions. et.al.|[2404.03736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03736)|null|
|**2024-04-07**|**RaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration**|NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has demonstrated tremendous potential in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but its performance is sensitive to input image quality, which struggles to achieve high-fidelity rendering when provided with low-quality sparse input viewpoints. Previous methods for NeRF restoration are tailored for specific degradation type, ignoring the generality of restoration. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generic radiance fields restoration pipeline, named RaFE, which applies to various types of degradations, such as low resolution, blurriness, noise, compression artifacts, or their combinations. Our approach leverages the success of off-the-shelf 2D restoration methods to recover the multi-view images individually. Instead of reconstructing a blurred NeRF by averaging inconsistencies, we introduce a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for NeRF generation to better accommodate the geometric and appearance inconsistencies present in the multi-view images. Specifically, we adopt a two-level tri-plane architecture, where the coarse level remains fixed to represent the low-quality NeRF, and a fine-level residual tri-plane to be added to the coarse level is modeled as a distribution with GAN to capture potential variations in restoration. We validate RaFE on both synthetic and real cases for various restoration tasks, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, surpassing other 3D restoration methods specific to single task.

|**2024-04-04**|**OpenNeRF: Open Set 3D Neural Scene Segmentation with Pixel-Wise Features and Rendered Novel Views**|Large visual-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, enable open-set image segmentation to segment arbitrary concepts from an image in a zero-shot manner. This goes beyond the traditional closed-set assumption, i.e., where models can only segment classes from a pre-defined training set. More recently, first works on open-set segmentation in 3D scenes have appeared in the literature. These methods are heavily influenced by closed-set 3D convolutional approaches that process point clouds or polygon meshes. However, these 3D scene representations do not align well with the image-based nature of the visual-language models. Indeed, point cloud and 3D meshes typically have a lower resolution than images and the reconstructed 3D scene geometry might not project well to the underlying 2D image sequences used to compute pixel-aligned CLIP features. To address these challenges, we propose OpenNeRF which naturally operates on posed images and directly encodes the VLM features within the NeRF. This is similar in spirit to LERF, however our work shows that using pixel-wise VLM features (instead of global CLIP features) results in an overall less complex architecture without the need for additional DINO regularization. Our OpenNeRF further leverages NeRF's ability to render novel views and extract open-set VLM features from areas that are not well observed in the initial posed images. For 3D point cloud segmentation on the Replica dataset, OpenNeRF outperforms recent open-vocabulary methods such as LERF and OpenScene by at least +4.9 mIoU. et.al.|[2404.03650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03650)|null|

In this paper, we consider the problem of rigid registration between two NeRFs when the position of the original cameras is not given. Our key novelty is the introduction of Viewshed Fields (VF), an implicit function that determines, for each 3D point, how likely it is to be viewed by the original cameras. We demonstrate how VF can help in the various stages of NeRF registration, with an extensive evaluation showing that VF-NeRF achieves SOTA results on various datasets with different capturing approaches such as LLFF and Objaverese. et.al.|[2404.03349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03349)|null|

Since the 3D consistency of 2D edits may not be assured, we propose to model the distribution of the underlying 3D edits through a generative model that can cover all possible edited NeRFs. To model the distribution of 3D edited NeRFs from 2D edited images, we carefully design a VAE-GAN that encodes images while decoding NeRFs. The latent space is trained to align with a Gaussian distribution and the NeRFs are supervised through an adversarial loss on its renderings. To ensure the latent code does not depend on 2D viewpoints but truly reflects the 3D edits, we also regularize the latent code through a contrastive learning scheme. Extensive experiments on various editing tasks show GenN2N, as a universal framework, performs as well or better than task-specific specialists while possessing flexible generative power.

In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Although prevalent methods achieve considerable improvements in small-scale scenes, accomplishing reconstruction in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging. First, the background in complex scenes shows a large variance among different views. Second, the current inference pattern, $i.e.$ , a pixel only relies on an individual camera ray, fails to capture contextual information. To solve these problems, we propose to enlarge the ray perception field and build up the sample points interactions. In this paper, we design a novel inference pattern that encourages a single camera ray possessing more contextual information, and models the relationship among sample points on each camera ray. To hold contextual information,a camera ray in our proposed method can render a patch of pixels simultaneously. Moreover, we replace the MLP in neural radiance field models with distance-aware convolutions to enhance the feature propagation among sample points from the same camera ray. To summarize, as a torchlight, a ray in our proposed method achieves rendering a patch of image. Thus, we call the proposed method, Torch-NeRF.

Recent NeRF editing pipelines lift 2D stylization results to 3D scenes while suffering from blurry results, and fail to capture detailed structures caused by the inconsistency between 2D editings. Our critical insight is that low-frequency components of images are more multiview-consistent after editing compared with their high-frequency parts. Moreover, the appearance style is mainly exhibited on the low-frequency components, and the content details especially reside in high-frequency parts. This motivates us to perform editing on low-frequency components, which results in high-fidelity edited scenes. In addition, the editing is performed in the low-frequency feature space, enabling stable intensity control and novel scene transfer.

Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical, we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically, we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads, while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss, yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters. At test time, the bitstreams containing latent code, feature decoder head, and other side information are transmitted for communication. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing NeRF compression methods, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with a memory budget of 0.5 MB. et.al.|[2404.02185](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02185)|null|

We call this property alpha invariance. For NeRFs to better maintain alpha invariance, we recommend 1) parameterizing both distance and volume densities in log space, and 2) a discretization-agnostic initialization strategy to guarantee high ray transmittance. We revisit a few popular radiance field models and find that these systems use various heuristics to deal with issues arising from scene scaling. We test their behaviors and show our recipe to be more robust. et.al.|[2404.02155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02155)|null|

This requires physical interaction with objects to build their internal representations. This paper presents an approach that enables a robot to rapidly learn the complete 3D model of a given object for manipulation in unfamiliar orientations. We use an ensemble of partially constructed NeRF models to quantify model uncertainty to determine the next action (a visual or re-orientation action) by optimizing informativeness and feasibility. Further, our approach determines when and how to grasp and re-orient an object given its partial NeRF model and re-estimates the object pose to rectify misalignments introduced during the interaction. Experiments with a simulated Franka Emika Robot Manipulator operating in a tabletop environment with benchmark objects demonstrate an improvement of (i) 14% in visual reconstruction quality (PSNR), (ii) 20% in the geometric/depth reconstruction of the object surface (F-score) and (iii) 71% in the task success rate of manipulating objects a-priori unseen orientations/stable configurations in the scene; over current methods.

|**2024-04-01**|**NVINS: Robust Visual Inertial Navigation Fused with NeRF-augmented Camera Pose Regressor and Uncertainty Quantification**|In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry(VIO) to provide a robust solution for robotic navigation in a real-time. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in the photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach. et.al.|[2404.01400](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01400)|null|
|**2024-04-01**|**NeRF-MAE : Masked AutoEncoders for Self Supervised 3D representation Learning for Neural Radiance Fields**|Neural fields excel in computer vision and robotics due to their ability to understand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, and dynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D scene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised pretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D representations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of extending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision Transformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF's volumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other 3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can be uneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applying masked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt for extracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domains by employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible by masking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing a standard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so, the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. We pretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data, totaling over 1.6 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used for effective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining for NeRFs, NeRF-MAE, scales remarkably well and improves performance on various challenging 3D tasks. Utilizing unlabeled posed 2D data for pretraining, NeRF-MAE significantly outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRF scene understanding baselines on Front3D and ScanNet datasets with an absolute performance improvement of over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection. et.al.|[2404.01300](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01300)|null|

|**2024-04-02**|**StructLDM: Structured Latent Diffusion for 3D Human Generation**|Recent 3D human generative models have achieved remarkable progress by learning 3D-aware GANs from 2D images. However, existing 3D human generative methods model humans in a compact 1D latent space, ignoring the articulated structure and semantics of human body topology. In this paper, we explore more expressive and higher-dimensional latent space for 3D human modeling and propose StructLDM, a diffusion-based unconditional 3D human generative model, which is learned from 2D images. StructLDM solves the challenges imposed due to the high-dimensional growth of latent space with three key designs: 1) A semantic structured latent space defined on the dense surface manifold of a statistical human body template. 2) A structured 3D-aware auto-decoder that factorizes the global latent space into several semantic body parts parameterized by a set of conditional structured local NeRFs anchored to the body template, which embeds the properties learned from the 2D training data and can be decoded to render view-consistent humans under different poses and clothing styles. 3) A structured latent diffusion model for generative human appearance sampling. Extensive experiments validate StructLDM's state-of-the-art generation performance and illustrate the expressiveness of the structured latent space over the well-adopted 1D latent space. Notably, StructLDM enables different levels of controllable 3D human generation and editing, including pose/view/shape control, and high-level tasks including compositional generations, part-aware clothing editing, 3D virtual try-on, etc. Our project page is at: https://taohuumd.github.io/projects/StructLDM/. et.al.|[2404.01241](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01241)|null|
|**2024-04-01**|**Mirror-3DGS: Incorporating Mirror Reflections into 3D Gaussian Splatting**|3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in the realm of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS, much like its predecessor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), struggles to accurately model physical reflections, particularly in mirrors that are ubiquitous in real-world scenes. This oversight mistakenly perceives reflections as separate entities that physically exist, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions and inconsistent reflective properties across varied viewpoints. To address this pivotal challenge, we introduce Mirror-3DGS, an innovative rendering framework devised to master the intricacies of mirror geometries and reflections, paving the way for the generation of realistically depicted mirror reflections. By ingeniously incorporating mirror attributes into the 3DGS and leveraging the principle of plane mirror imaging, Mirror-3DGS crafts a mirrored viewpoint to observe from behind the mirror, enriching the realism of scene renderings. Extensive assessments, spanning both synthetic and real-world scenes, showcase our method's ability to render novel views with enhanced fidelity in real-time, surpassing the state-of-the-art Mirror-NeRF specifically within the challenging mirror regions. Our code will be made publicly available for reproducible research. et.al.|[2404.01168](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01168)|null|
|**2024-04-01**|**SGCNeRF: Few-Shot Neural Rendering via Sparse Geometric Consistency Guidance**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) technology has made significant strides in creating novel viewpoints. However, its effectiveness is hampered when working with sparsely available views, often leading to performance dips due to overfitting. FreeNeRF attempts to overcome this limitation by integrating implicit geometry regularization, which incrementally improves both geometry and textures. Nonetheless, an initial low positional encoding bandwidth results in the exclusion of high-frequency elements. The quest for a holistic approach that simultaneously addresses overfitting and the preservation of high-frequency details remains ongoing. This study introduces a novel feature matching based sparse geometry regularization module. This module excels in pinpointing high-frequency keypoints, thereby safeguarding the integrity of fine details. Through progressive refinement of geometry and textures across NeRF iterations, we unveil an effective few-shot neural rendering architecture, designated as SGCNeRF, for enhanced novel view synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that SGCNeRF not only achieves superior geometry-consistent outcomes but also surpasses FreeNeRF, with improvements of 0.7 dB and 0.6 dB in PSNR on the LLFF and DTU datasets, respectively. et.al.|[2404.00992](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00992)|null|
|**2024-04-01**|**FlexiDreamer: Single Image-to-3D Generation with FlexiCubes**|3D content generation from text prompts or single images has made remarkable progress in quality and speed recently. One of its dominant paradigms involves generating consistent multi-view images followed by a sparse-view reconstruction. However, due to the challenge of directly deforming the mesh representation to approach the target topology, most methodologies learn an implicit representation (such as NeRF) during the sparse-view reconstruction and acquire the target mesh by a post-processing extraction. Although the implicit representation can effectively model rich 3D information, its training typically entails a long convergence time. In addition, the post-extraction operation from the implicit field also leads to undesirable visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose FlexiDreamer, a novel single image-to-3d generation framework that reconstructs the target mesh in an end-to-end manner. By leveraging a flexible gradient-based extraction known as FlexiCubes, our method circumvents the defects brought by the post-processing and facilitates a direct acquisition of the target mesh. Furthermore, we incorporate a multi-resolution hash grid encoding scheme that progressively activates the encoding levels into the implicit field in FlexiCubes to help capture geometric details for per-step optimization. Notably, FlexiDreamer recovers a dense 3D structure from a single-view image in approximately 1 minute on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, outperforming previous methodologies by a large margin. et.al.|[2404.00987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00987)|null|
|**2024-04-01**|**Marrying NeRF with Feature Matching for One-step Pose Estimation**|Given the image collection of an object, we aim at building a real-time image-based pose estimation method, which requires neither its CAD model nor hours of object-specific training. Recent NeRF-based methods provide a promising solution by directly optimizing the pose from pixel loss between rendered and target images. However, during inference, they require long converging time, and suffer from local minima, making them impractical for real-time robot applications. We aim at solving this problem by marrying image matching with NeRF. With 2D matches and depth rendered by NeRF, we directly solve the pose in one step by building 2D-3D correspondences between target and initial view, thus allowing for real-time prediction. Moreover, to improve the accuracy of 2D-3D correspondences, we propose a 3D consistent point mining strategy, which effectively discards unfaithful points reconstruted by NeRF. Moreover, current NeRF-based methods naively optimizing pixel loss fail at occluded images. Thus, we further propose a 2D matches based sampling strategy to preclude the occluded area. Experimental results on representative datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and improves inference efficiency by 90x, achieving real-time prediction at 6 FPS. et.al.|[2404.00891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00891)|null|

Recent advancements in mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces two challenges, including incomplete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this end, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstruction speed. et.al.|[2403.20159](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20159)|null|

However, they often struggle to reconstruct complete face geometry due to the absence of comprehensive 3D information in the input monocular videos. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio-driven talking head synthesis framework, called Talk3D, that can faithfully reconstruct its plausible facial geometries by effectively adopting the pre-trained 3D-aware generative prior. Given the personalized 3D generative model, we present a novel audio-guided attention U-Net architecture that predicts the dynamic face variations in the NeRF space driven by audio. Furthermore, our model is further modulated by audio-unrelated conditioning tokens which effectively disentangle variations unrelated to audio features. Compared to existing methods, our method excels in generating realistic facial geometries even under extreme head poses. We also conduct extensive experiments showing our approach surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. et.al.|[2403.20153](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20153)|null|
|**2024-03-29**|**SGD: Street View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Prior**|Novel View Synthesis (NVS) for street scenes play a critical role in the autonomous driving simulation. The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views. et.al.|[2403.20079](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20079)|null|

One notable development is the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in these systems, which utilizes implicit neural representation to encode 3D scenes. This extension of NeRF to SLAM has shown promising results. However, the depth images obtained from consumer-grade RGB-D sensors are often sparse and noisy, which poses significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and affects the accuracy of the representation of the scene geometry. Moreover, the original hierarchical feature grid with occupancy value is inaccurate for scene geometry representation. Furthermore, the existing methods select random pixels for camera tracking, which leads to inaccurate localization and is not robust in real-world indoor environments. To this end, we present NeSLAM, an advanced framework that achieves accurate and dense depth estimation, robust camera tracking, and realistic synthesis of novel views. First, a depth completion and denoising network is designed to provide dense geometry prior and guide the neural implicit representation optimization. Second, the occupancy scene representation is replaced with Signed Distance Field (SDF) hierarchical scene representation for high-quality reconstruction and view synthesis. Furthermore, we also propose a NeRF-based self-supervised feature tracking algorithm for robust real-time tracking.

SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, which not only reduces storage requirements but also offers potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, to take one step further, our approach builds upon the powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view image synthesis.

To tackle these limitations, we propose a method to reconstruct the clear 3D scene implicitly from multi-view images degraded by waterdrops. Our method exploits an attention network to predict the location of waterdrops and then train a Neural Radiance Fields to recover the 3D scene implicitly. By leveraging the strong scene representation capabilities of NeRF, our method can render high-quality novel-view images with waterdrops removed.

|**2024-03-29**|**Stable Surface Regularization for Fast Few-Shot NeRF**|This paper proposes an algorithm for synthesizing novel views under few-shot setup. The main concept is to develop a stable surface regularization technique called Annealing Signed Distance Function (ASDF), which anneals the surface in a coarse-to-fine manner to accelerate convergence speed. We observe that the Eikonal loss - which is a widely known geometric regularization - requires dense training signal to shape different level-sets of SDF, leading to low-fidelity results under few-shot training. In contrast, the proposed surface regularization successfully reconstructs scenes and produce high-fidelity geometry with stable training. Our method is further accelerated by utilizing grid representation and monocular geometric priors. Finally, the proposed approach is up to 45 times faster than existing few-shot novel view synthesis methods, and it produces comparable results in the ScanNet dataset and NeRF-Real dataset. et.al.|[2403.19985](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19985)|null|

NeRFs have shown remarkable results in modeling the 4D dynamics and appearance of human faces. However, they require per-identity optimization. Although recent approaches have proposed techniques to reduce the training and rendering time, increasing the number of identities can be expensive. We introduce MI-NeRF (multi-identity NeRF), a single unified network that models complex non-rigid facial motion for multiple identities, using only monocular videos of arbitrary length. The core premise in our method is to learn the non-linear interactions between identity and non-identity specific information with a multiplicative module. By training on multiple videos simultaneously, MI-NeRF not only reduces the total training time compared to standard single-identity NeRFs, but also demonstrates robustness in synthesizing novel expressions for any input identity. We present results for both facial expression transfer and talking face video synthesis.

|**2024-03-28**|**Mitigating Motion Blur in Neural Radiance Fields with Events and Frames**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in novel view synthesis. However, they struggle to render sharp images when the data used for training is affected by motion blur. On the other hand, event cameras excel in dynamic scenes as they measure brightness changes with microsecond resolution and are thus only marginally affected by blur. Recent methods attempt to enhance NeRF reconstructions under camera motion by fusing frames and events. However, they face challenges in recovering accurate color content or constrain the NeRF to a set of predefined camera poses, harming reconstruction quality in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel formulation addressing these issues by leveraging both model- and learning-based modules. We explicitly model the blur formation process, exploiting the event double integral as an additional model-based prior. Additionally, we model the event-pixel response using an end-to-end learnable response function, allowing our method to adapt to non-idealities in the real event-camera sensor. We show, on synthetic and real data, that the proposed approach outperforms existing deblur NeRFs that use only frames as well as those that combine frames and events by +6.13dB and +2.48dB, respectively. et.al.|[2403.19780](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19780)|**[link](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/evdeblurnerf)**|

Depth estimation/completion methods are typically employed and trained on datasets with quality depth labels acquired from either simulation, additional sensors or specialized data collection setups and known 3d models. However, acquiring reliable depth information for datasets at scale is not straightforward, limiting training scalability and generalization. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are learning-free approaches and have demonstrated wide success in novel view synthesis and shape recovery. However, heuristics and controlled environments (lights, backgrounds, etc) are often required to accurately capture specular surfaces. In this paper, we propose using Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation in a zero-shot, label-free way to guide the NeRF reconstruction process for these objects via the simultaneous reconstruction of semantic fields and extensions to increase robustness.

The latter provides a significant edge over NeRF in terms of the training and inference speed, as well as the reconstruction quality. Although 3DGS works well for dense input images, the unstructured point-cloud like representation quickly overfits to the more challenging setup of extremely sparse input images (e.g., 3 images), creating a representation that appears as a jumble of needles from novel views. To address this issue, we propose regularized optimization and depth-based initialization. Our key idea is to introduce a structured Gaussian representation that can be controlled in 2D image space. We then constraint the Gaussians, in particular their position, and prevent them from moving independently during optimization. Specifically, we introduce single and multiview constraints through an implicit convolutional decoder and a total variation loss, respectively. With the coherency introduced to the Gaussians, we further constrain the optimization through a flow-based loss function. To support our regularized optimization, we propose an approach to initialize the Gaussians using monocular depth estimates at each input view. We demonstrate significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art sparse-view NeRF-based approaches on a variety of scenes. et.al.|[2403.19495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19495)|null|

Mesh2NeRF extracts accurate radiance fields which provides direct supervision for training generative NeRFs and single scene representation. We validate the effectiveness of Mesh2NeRF across various tasks, achieving a noteworthy 3.12dB improvement in PSNR for view synthesis in single scene representation on the ABO dataset, a 0.69 PSNR enhancement in the single-view conditional generation of ShapeNet Cars, and notably improved mesh extraction from NeRF in the unconditional generation of Objaverse Mugs. et.al.|[2403.19319](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19319)|null|

|**2024-03-27**|**SAT-NGP : Unleashing Neural Graphics Primitives for Fast Relightable Transient-Free 3D reconstruction from Satellite Imagery**|Current stereo-vision pipelines produce high accuracy 3D reconstruction when using multiple pairs or triplets of satellite images. However, these pipelines are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows, reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate the learning. Our model, Satellite Neural Graphics Primitives (SAT-NGP) decreases the learning time to 15 minutes while maintaining the quality of the 3D reconstruction. et.al.|[2403.18711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18711)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**Modeling uncertainty for Gaussian Splatting**|We present Stochastic Gaussian Splatting (SGS): the first framework for uncertainty estimation using Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS recently advanced the novel-view synthesis field by achieving impressive reconstruction quality at a fraction of the computational cost of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, contrary to the latter, it still lacks the ability to provide information about the confidence associated with their outputs. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a Variational Inference-based approach that seamlessly integrates uncertainty prediction into the common rendering pipeline of GS. Additionally, we introduce the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) as a new term in the loss function, enabling optimization of uncertainty estimation alongside image reconstruction. Experimental results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both image rendering quality and uncertainty estimation accuracy. Overall, our framework equips practitioners with valuable insights into the reliability of synthesized views, facilitating safer decision-making in real-world applications. et.al.|[2403.18476](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18476)|null|
|**2024-03-26**|**Octree-GS: Towards Consistent Real-time Rendering with LOD-Structured 3D Gaussians**|The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has shown remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency compared to NeRF-based neural scene representations. While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results. et.al.|[2403.17898](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17898)|null|

However, their effectiveness is inherently tied to the assumption of static scenes, rendering them susceptible to undesirable artifacts when confronted with transient distractors such as moving objects or shadows. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm, namely "Heuristics-Guided Segmentation" (HuGS), which significantly enhances the separation of static scenes from transient distractors by harmoniously combining the strengths of hand-crafted heuristics and state-of-the-art segmentation models, thus significantly transcending the limitations of previous solutions. Furthermore, we delve into the meticulous design of heuristics, introducing a seamless fusion of Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based heuristics and color residual heuristics, catering to a diverse range of texture profiles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method in mitigating transient distractors for NeRFs trained in non-static scenes.

|**2024-03-25**|**VP3D: Unleashing 2D Visual Prompt for Text-to-3D Generation**|Recent innovations on text-to-3D generation have featured Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models (NeRF) by directly distilling prior knowledge from 2D diffusion models. However, current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work, we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation. Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt, VP3D first capitalizes on 2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text, which subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit visual appearance. Meanwhile, we couple the SDS optimization with additional differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text prompt. Through extensive experiments, we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a given reference image, VP3D is able to trigger a new task of stylized text-to-3D generation.

However, when trained on sparse inputs, NeRF typically encounters issues of incorrect density or color predictions, mainly due to insufficient coverage of the scene causing partial and sparse supervision, thus leading to significant performance degradation. While existing works mainly consider ray-level consistency to construct 2D learning regularization based on rendered color, depth, or semantics on image planes, in this paper we propose a novel approach that models 3D spatial field consistency to improve NeRF's performance with sparse inputs. Specifically, we first adopt a voxel-based ray sampling strategy to ensure that the sampled rays intersect with a certain voxel in 3D space. We then randomly sample additional points within the voxel and apply a Transformer to infer the properties of other points on each ray, which are then incorporated into the volume rendering. By backpropagating through the rendering loss, we enhance the consistency among neighboring points. Additionally, we propose to use a contrastive loss on the encoder output of the Transformer to further improve consistency within each voxel. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant improvement over different radiance fields in the sparse inputs setting, and achieves comparable performance with current works. et.al.|[2403.16885](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16885)|null|

Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes. Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time. To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator. Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes.

It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering engines, compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). On the other hand, existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods cannot handle glossy objects with local light interactions well, as they typically oversimplify the illumination as a 2D environmental map, which assumes infinite lights only. Observing the superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields, we propose a novel 5D Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing, such that more accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first stage, and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on the proposed real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-fidelity geometry/materials of challenging glossy objects with complex lighting interactions from nearby objects.

In such settings, it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method, termed here as Entity-NeRF, which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics, leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation. To assess our methodology, we created an urban scene dataset masked with moving objects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Entity-NeRF notably outperforms existing techniques in removing moving objects and reconstructing static urban backgrounds, both quantitatively and qualitatively. et.al.|[2403.16141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16141)|null|

Through an in-depth analysis of Gaussian Splatting, we propose several techniques to construct a consistent and stable 3D Gaussian field suitable for tracking and mapping. Additionally, a novel depth uncertainty model is proposed to ensure the selection of valuable Gaussian primitives during optimization, thereby improving tracking efficiency and accuracy.

Towards closing the real-to-simulation gap**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as promising tools for advancing autonomous driving (AD) research, offering scalable closed-loop simulation and data augmentation capabilities. However, to trust the results achieved in simulation, one needs to ensure that AD systems perceive real and rendered data in the same way. Although the performance of rendering methods is increasing, many scenarios will remain inherently challenging to reconstruct faithfully. To this end, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the real-to-simulated data gap. Rather than solely focusing on improving rendering fidelity, we explore simple yet effective methods to enhance perception model robustness to NeRF artifacts without compromising performance on real data. Moreover, we conduct the first large-scale investigation into the real-to-simulated data gap in an AD setting using a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Specifically, we evaluate object detectors and an online mapping model on real and simulated data, and study the effects of different pre-training strategies. Our results show notable improvements in model robustness to simulated data, even improving real-world performance in some cases. Last, we delve into the correlation between the real-to-simulated gap and image reconstruction metrics, identifying FID and LPIPS as strong indicators. et.al.|[2403.16092](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16092)|null|

Despite considerable efforts invested in developing various capture systems and reconstruction algorithms, recent advancements still struggle with loose or oversized clothing and overly complex poses. In part, this is due to the challenges of acquiring high-quality human datasets. To facilitate the development of these fields, in this paper, we present PKU-DyMVHumans, a versatile human-centric dataset for high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering of dynamic human scenarios from dense multi-view videos. It comprises 8.2 million frames captured by more than 56 synchronized cameras across diverse scenarios. These sequences comprise 32 human subjects across 45 different scenarios, each with a high-detailed appearance and realistic human motion.

This research aims to extend the Semantic Neural Radiance Fields (Semantic-NeRF) model by focusing solely on semantic output and removing the RGB output component. We reformulate the model and its training procedure to leverage only the cross-entropy loss between the model semantic output and the ground truth semantic images, removing the colour data traditionally used in the original Semantic-NeRF approach. We then conduct a series of identical experiments using the original and the modified Semantic-NeRF model. Our primary objective is to obverse the impact of this modification on the model performance by Semantic-NeRF, focusing on tasks such as scene understanding, object detection, and segmentation.

Traditional phenotyping in controlled laboratory environments, while valuable, falls short in understanding plant growth under real-world conditions. Emerging sensor and digital technologies offer a promising approach for direct phenotyping of plants in farm environments. This study investigates a learning-based phenotyping method using the Neural Radiance Field to achieve accurate in-situ phenotyping of pepper plants in greenhouse environments. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of this method, traditional point cloud registration on 3D scanning data is implemented for comparison. Experimental result shows that NeRF(Neural Radiance Fields) achieves competitive accuracy compared to the 3D scanning methods.

|**2024-03-23**|**DriveEnv-NeRF: Exploration of A NeRF-Based Autonomous Driving Environment for Real-World Performance Validation**|In this study, we introduce the DriveEnv-NeRF framework, which leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to enable the validation and faithful forecasting of the efficacy of autonomous driving agents in a targeted real-world scene. Standard simulator-based rendering often fails to accurately reflect real-world performance due to the sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between virtual simulations and real-world conditions. To mitigate this gap, we propose a workflow for building a high-fidelity simulation environment of the targeted real-world scene using NeRF. This approach is capable of rendering realistic images from novel viewpoints and constructing 3D meshes for emulating collisions. The validation of these capabilities through the comparison of success rates in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the benefits of using DriveEnv-NeRF as a real-world performance indicator. Furthermore, the DriveEnv-NeRF framework can serve as a training environment for autonomous driving agents under various lighting conditions. This approach enhances the robustness of the agents and reduces performance degradation when deployed to the target real scene, compared to agents fully trained using the standard simulator rendering pipeline. et.al.|[2403.15791](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15791)|null|
|**2024-03-23**|**UPNeRF: A Unified Framework for Monocular 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation**|Monocular 3D reconstruction for categorical objects heavily relies on accurately perceiving each object's pose. While gradient-based optimization within a NeRF framework updates initially given poses, this paper highlights that such a scheme fails when the initial pose even moderately deviates from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present UPNeRF, a Unified framework integrating Pose estimation and NeRF-based reconstruction, bringing us closer to real-time monocular 3D object reconstruction. UPNeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces an effective projected-box representation that generalizes well cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, UPNeRF is free from external 3D detectors. UPNeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, UPNeRF exhibits exceptional Cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50% reduction in rotation and translation error. et.al.|[2403.15705](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15705)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**WSCLoc: Weakly-Supervised Sparse-View Camera Relocalization**|Despite the advancements in deep learning for camera relocalization tasks, obtaining ground truth pose labels required for the training process remains a costly endeavor. While current weakly supervised methods excel in lightweight label generation, their performance notably declines in scenarios with sparse views. In response to this challenge, we introduce WSCLoc, a system capable of being customized to various deep learning-based relocalization models to enhance their performance under weakly-supervised and sparse view conditions. This is realized with two stages. In the initial stage, WSCLoc employs a multilayer perceptron-based structure called WFT-NeRF to co-optimize image reconstruction quality and initial pose information. To ensure a stable learning process, we incorporate temporal information as input. Furthermore, instead of optimizing SE(3), we opt for $\mathfrak{sim}(3)$ optimization to explicitly enforce a scale constraint. In the second stage, we co-optimize the pre-trained WFT-NeRF and WFT-Pose. This optimization is enhanced by Time-Encoding based Random View Synthesis and supervised by inter-frame geometric constraints that consider pose, depth, and RGB information. We validate our approaches on two publicly available datasets, one outdoor and one indoor. Our experimental results demonstrate that our weakly-supervised relocalization solutions achieve superior pose estimation accuracy in sparse-view scenarios, comparable to state-of-the-art camera relocalization methods. We will make our code publicly available. et.al.|[2403.15272](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15272)|null|

There is growing interest in creating 3D hyperspectral reconstructions, which could provide both spatial and spectral information while also mitigating common HSI challenges such as non-Lambertian surfaces and translucent objects. However, traditional 3D reconstruction with HSI is difficult due to technological limitations of hyperspectral cameras. In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have seen widespread success in creating high quality volumetric 3D representations of scenes captured by a variety of camera models. Leveraging recent advances in NeRFs, we propose computing a hyperspectral 3D reconstruction in which every point in space and view direction is characterized by wavelength-dependent radiance and transmittance spectra. To evaluate our approach, a dataset containing nearly 2000 hyperspectral images across 8 scenes and 2 cameras was collected. We perform comparisons against traditional RGB NeRF baselines and apply ablation testing with alternative spectra representations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of hyperspectral NeRFs for hyperspectral super-resolution and imaging sensor simulation. We show that our hyperspectral NeRF approach enables creating fast, accurate volumetric 3D hyperspectral scenes and enables several new applications and areas for future study. et.al.|[2403.14839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14839)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**ClusteringSDF: Self-Organized Neural Implicit Surfaces for 3D Decomposition**|3D decomposition/segmentation still remains a challenge as large-scale 3D annotated data is not readily available. Contemporary approaches typically leverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency. While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potential weakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independent MLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometric details of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, we propose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation and reconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation, specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation rendering is directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces. Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires the ground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability of reconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy and inconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, we introduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3D and the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance compared against the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time. et.al.|[2403.14619](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14619)|null|

When dealing with few-shot settings, i.e. with a small set of input views, the training could overfit those views, leading to artifacts and geometric and chromatic inconsistencies in the resulting rendering. Regularization is a valid solution that helps NeRF generalization. On the other hand, each of the most recent NeRF regularization techniques aim to mitigate a specific rendering problem. Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose CombiNeRF, a framework that synergically combines several regularization techniques, some of them novel, in order to unify the benefits of each. In particular, we regularize single and neighboring rays distributions and we add a smoothness term to regularize near geometries. After these geometric approaches, we propose to exploit Lipschitz regularization to both NeRF density and color networks and to use encoding masks for input features regularization. We show that CombiNeRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with few-shot settings in several publicly available datasets.

In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n).

|**2024-03-21**|**Leveraging Thermal Modality to Enhance Reconstruction in Low-Light Conditions**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) accomplishes photo-realistic novel view synthesis by learning the implicit volumetric representation of a scene from multi-view images, which faithfully convey the colorimetric information. However, sensor noises will contaminate low-value pixel signals, and the lossy camera image signal processor will further remove near-zero intensities in extremely dark situations, deteriorating the synthesis performance. Existing approaches reconstruct low-light scenes from raw images but struggle to recover texture and boundary details in dark regions. Additionally, they are unsuitable for high-speed models relying on explicit representations. To address these issues, we present Thermal-NeRF, which takes thermal and visible raw images as inputs, considering the thermal camera is robust to the illumination variation and raw images preserve any possible clues in the dark, to accomplish visible and thermal view synthesis simultaneously. Also, the first multi-view thermal and visible dataset (MVTV) is established to support the research on multimodal NeRF. Thermal-NeRF achieves the best trade-off between detail preservation and noise smoothing and provides better synthesis performance than previous work.

Our approach addresses key challenges in multi-robot 3D reconstruction, including inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. We introduce a method for using wireless Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and ranging measurements to estimate relative poses between robots, as well as quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty embedded in the wireless localization of these pose estimates into the NeRF training loss to mitigate the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Furthermore, we propose an active view selection approach that accounts for robot pose uncertainty when determining the next-best views to improve the 3D reconstruction, enabling faster convergence through intelligent view selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in theory and in practice. Leveraging wireless coordination and localization uncertainty-aware training, MULAN-WC can achieve high-quality 3d reconstruction which is close to applying the ground truth camera poses. Furthermore, the quantification of the information gain from a novel view enables consistent rendering quality improvement with incrementally captured images by commending the robot the novel view position.

|**2024-03-19**|**Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of predicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide enough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries yielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision during NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be perfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more challenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in depth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or uncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know that depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through L2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth metrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric measures. et.al.|[2403.13206](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206)|null|

However, most of this captured visual data remains siloed in our camera rolls as these images contain personal details. Even if made public, the problem of learning 3D representations of billions of scenes captured daily in a centralized manner is computationally intractable. Our approach, DecentNeRF, is the first attempt at decentralized, crowd-sourced NeRFs that require $\sim 10^4\times$ less server computing for a scene than a centralized approach. Instead of sending the raw data, our approach requires users to send a 3D representation, distributing the high computation cost of training centralized NeRFs between the users. It learns photorealistic scene representations by decomposing users' 3D views into personal and global NeRFs and a novel optimally weighted aggregation of only the latter. We validate the advantage of our approach to learn NeRFs with photorealism and minimal server computation cost on structured synthetic and real-world photo tourism datasets. We further analyze how secure aggregation of global NeRFs in DecentNeRF minimizes the undesired reconstruction of personal content by the server. et.al.|[2403.13199](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13199)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**Global-guided Focal Neural Radiance Field for Large-scale Scene Rendering**|Neural radiance fields~(NeRF) have recently been applied to render large-scale scenes. However, their limited model capacity typically results in blurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this limitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently handled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and processed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance across the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit significant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work, we present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a two-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training strategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire scene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and further processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage architecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder, thus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining scene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the global stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and effectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach does not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing GF-NeRF adaptable to various large-scale scene types, including street-view and aerial-view scenes. We demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity, natural rendering results on various types of large-scale datasets.

|**2024-03-19**|**Learning Neural Volumetric Pose Features for Camera Localization**|We introduce a novel neural volumetric pose feature, termed PoseMap, designed to enhance camera localization by encapsulating the information between images and the associated camera poses. Our framework leverages an Absolute Pose Regression (APR) architecture, together with an augmented NeRF module. This integration not only facilitates the generation of novel views to enrich the training dataset but also enables the learning of effective pose features. Additionally, we extend our architecture for self-supervised online alignment, allowing our method to be used and fine-tuned for unlabelled images within a unified framework. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 14.28% and 20.51% performance gain on average in indoor and outdoor benchmark scenes, outperforming existing APR methods with state-of-the-art accuracy. et.al.|[2403.12800](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12800)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**IFFNeRF: Initialisation Free and Fast 6DoF pose estimation from a single image and a NeRF model**|We introduce IFFNeRF to estimate the six degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) camera pose of a given image, building on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) formulation. IFFNeRF is specifically designed to operate in real-time and eliminates the need for an initial pose guess that is proximate to the sought solution. IFFNeRF utilizes the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to sample surface points from within the NeRF model. From these sampled points, we cast rays and deduce the color for each ray through pixel-level view synthesis. The camera pose can then be estimated as the solution to a Least Squares problem by selecting correspondences between the query image and the resulting bundle. We facilitate this process through a learned attention mechanism, bridging the query image embedding with the embedding of parameterized rays, thereby matching rays pertinent to the image. Through synthetic and real evaluation settings, we show that our method can improve the angular and translation error accuracy by 80.1% and 67.3%, respectively, compared to iNeRF while performing at 34fps on consumer hardware and not requiring the initial pose guess. et.al.|[2403.12682](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12682)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**FLex: Joint Pose and Dynamic Radiance Fields Optimization for Stereo Endoscopic Videos**|Reconstruction of endoscopic scenes is an important asset for various medical applications, from post-surgery analysis to educational training. Neural rendering has recently shown promising results in endoscopic reconstruction with deforming tissue. However, the setup has been restricted to a static endoscope, limited deformation, or required an external tracking device to retrieve camera pose information of the endoscopic camera. With FLex we adress the challenging setup of a moving endoscope within a highly dynamic environment of deforming tissue. We propose an implicit scene separation into multiple overlapping 4D neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and a progressive optimization scheme jointly optimizing for reconstruction and camera poses from scratch. This improves the ease-of-use and allows to scale reconstruction capabilities in time to process surgical videos of 5,000 frames and more; an improvement of more than ten times compared to the state of the art while being agnostic to external tracking information. Extensive evaluations on the StereoMIS dataset show that FLex significantly improves the quality of novel view synthesis while maintaining competitive pose accuracy. et.al.|[2403.12198](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12198)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**ThermoNeRF: Multimodal Neural Radiance Fields for Thermal Novel View Synthesis**|Thermal scene reconstruction exhibit great potential for applications across a broad spectrum of fields, including building energy consumption analysis and non-destructive testing. However, existing methods typically require dense scene measurements and often rely on RGB images for 3D geometry reconstruction, with thermal information being projected post-reconstruction. This two-step strategy, adopted due to the lack of texture in thermal images, can lead to disparities between the geometry and temperatures of the reconstructed objects and those of the actual scene. To address this challenge, we propose ThermoNeRF, a novel multimodal approach based on Neural Radiance Fields, capable of rendering new RGB and thermal views of a scene jointly. To overcome the lack of texture in thermal images, we use paired RGB and thermal images to learn scene density, while distinct networks estimate color and temperature information. Furthermore, we introduce ThermoScenes, a new dataset to palliate the lack of available RGB+thermal datasets for scene reconstruction. Experimental results validate that ThermoNeRF achieves accurate thermal image synthesis, with an average mean absolute error of 1.5 $^\circ$ C, an improvement of over 50% compared to using concatenated RGB+thermal data with Nerfacto, a state-of-the-art NeRF method. et.al.|[2403.12154](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12154)|**[link](https://github.com/schindlerepfl/thermo-nerf)**|
|**2024-03-18**|**RoGUENeRF: A Robust Geometry-Consistent Universal Enhancer for NeRF**|Recent advances in neural rendering have enabled highly photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Despite this progress, current state-of-the-art methods struggle to reconstruct high frequency detail, due to factors such as a low-frequency bias of radiance fields and inaccurate camera calibration. One approach to mitigate this issue is to enhance images post-rendering. 2D enhancers can be pre-trained to recover some detail but are agnostic to scene geometry and do not easily generalize to new distributions of image degradation. Conversely, existing 3D enhancers are able to transfer detail from nearby training images in a generalizable manner, but suffer from inaccurate camera calibration and can propagate errors from the geometry into rendered images. We propose a neural rendering enhancer, RoGUENeRF, which exploits the best of both paradigms. Our method is pre-trained to learn a general enhancer while also leveraging information from nearby training images via robust 3D alignment and geometry-aware fusion. Our approach restores high-frequency textures while maintaining geometric consistency and is also robust to inaccurate camera calibration. We show that RoGUENeRF substantially enhances the rendering quality of a wide range of neural rendering baselines, e.g. improving the PSNR of MipNeRF360 by 0.63dB and Nerfacto by 1.34dB on the real world 360v2 dataset. et.al.|[2403.11909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11909)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**GNeRP: Gaussian-guided Neural Reconstruction of Reflective Objects with Noisy Polarization Priors**|Learning surfaces from neural radiance field (NeRF) became a rising topic in Multi-View Stereo (MVS). Recent Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods demonstrated their ability to reconstruct accurate 3D shapes of Lambertian scenes. However, their results on reflective scenes are unsatisfactory due to the entanglement of specular radiance and complicated geometry. To address the challenges, we propose a Gaussian-based representation of normals in SDF fields. Supervised by polarization priors, this representation guides the learning of geometry behind the specular reflection and captures more details than existing methods. Moreover, we propose a reweighting strategy in the optimization process to alleviate the noise issue of polarization priors. To validate the effectiveness of our design, we capture polarimetric information, and ground truth meshes in additional reflective scenes with various geometry. We also evaluated our framework on the PANDORA dataset. Comparisons prove our method outperforms existing neural 3D reconstruction methods in reflective scenes by a large margin. et.al.|[2403.11899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11899)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**Exploring Multi-modal Neural Scene Representations With Applications on Thermal Imaging**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) quickly evolved as the new de-facto standard for the task of novel view synthesis when trained on a set of RGB images. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene representations, such as NeRFs, in the context of multi-modal learning. Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate component to predict (color) values of the additional modality. We chose thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene representations. For the evaluation of the proposed strategies, we captured a new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF performs best for novel view synthesis on thermal images while also yielding compelling results on RGB. Finally, we also show that our analysis generalizes to other modalities, including near-infrared images and depth maps.

|**2024-03-19**|**BAD-Gaussians: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting**|While neural rendering has demonstrated impressive capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it heavily relies on high-quality sharp images and accurate camera poses. Numerous approaches have been proposed to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with motion-blurred images, commonly encountered in real-world scenarios such as low-light or long-exposure conditions. However, the implicit representation of NeRF struggles to accurately recover intricate details from severely motion-blurred images and cannot achieve real-time rendering. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time rendering by explicitly optimizing point clouds as Gaussian spheres.   In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named BAD-Gaussians (Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting), which leverages explicit Gaussian representation and handles severe motion-blurred images with inaccurate camera poses to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction. Our method models the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and jointly learns the parameters of Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time.   In our experiments, we demonstrate that BAD-Gaussians not only achieves superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art deblur neural rendering methods on both synthetic and real datasets but also enables real-time rendering capabilities.

|**2024-03-18**|**Aerial Lifting: Neural Urban Semantic and Building Instance Lifting from Aerial Imagery**|We present a neural radiance field method for urban-scale semantic and building-level instance segmentation from aerial images by lifting noisy 2D labels to 3D. This is a challenging problem due to two primary reasons. Firstly, objects in urban aerial images exhibit substantial variations in size, including buildings, cars, and roads, which pose a significant challenge for accurate 2D segmentation. Secondly, the 2D labels generated by existing segmentation methods suffer from the multi-view inconsistency problem, especially in the case of aerial images, where each image captures only a small portion of the entire scene. To overcome these limitations, we first introduce a scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy that enhances the segmentation of objects of varying sizes by combining labels predicted from different altitudes, harnessing the novel-view synthesis capabilities of NeRF. We then introduce a novel cross-view instance label grouping strategy based on the 3D scene representation to mitigate the multi-view inconsistency problem in the 2D instance labels. Furthermore, we exploit multi-view reconstructed depth priors to improve the geometric quality of the reconstructed radiance field, resulting in enhanced segmentation results. Experiments on multiple real-world urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness. et.al.|[2403.11812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11812)|null|

|**2024-03-18**|**UV Gaussians: Joint Learning of Mesh Deformation and Gaussian Textures for Human Avatar Modeling**|Reconstructing photo-realistic drivable human avatars from multi-view image sequences has been a popular and challenging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics. While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are time-consuming. Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the human body, enabling faster training and rendering. However, they undermine the importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with coarse mesh guidance. This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and tends to produce blurry textures. Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space Gaussian textures. We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to extract features. Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian rendering and significantly enhancing rendering quality. We collect and process a new dataset of human motion, which includes multi-view images, scanned models, parametric model registration, and corresponding texture maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art synthesis of novel view and novel pose.

To deal with it, augmenting minority-class examples by sampling ground truth (GT) LiDAR points from a database and pasting them into a scene of interest is often used, but challenges still remain: inflexibility in locating GT samples and limited sample diversity. In this work, we propose to leverage pseudo-LiDAR point clouds generated (at a low cost) from videos capturing a surround view of miniatures or real-world objects of minor classes. Our method, called Pseudo Ground Truth Augmentation (PGT-Aug), consists of three main steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity estimation and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information. We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations.

|**2024-03-17**|**Creating Seamless 3D Maps Using Radiance Fields**|It is desirable to create 3D object models and 3D maps from 2D input images for applications such as navigation, virtual tourism, and urban planning. The traditional methods of creating 3D maps, (such as photogrammetry), require a large number of images and odometry. Additionally, traditional methods have difficulty with reflective surfaces and specular reflections; windows and chrome in the scene can be problematic. Google Road View is a familiar application, which uses traditional methods to fuse a collection of 2D input images into the illusion of a 3D map. However, Google Road View does not create an actual 3D object model, only a collection of views. The objective of this work is to create an actual 3D object model using updated techniques. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF[1]) has emerged as a potential solution, offering the capability to produce more precise and intricate 3D maps. Gaussian Splatting[4] is another contemporary technique. This investigation compares Neural Radiance Fields to Gaussian Splatting, and describes some of their inner workings.

However, existing approaches reliant on spike cameras often assume optimal illumination, a condition frequently unmet in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce SpikeNeRF, the first work that derives a NeRF-based volumetric scene representation from spike camera data. Our approach leverages NeRF's multi-view consistency to establish robust self-supervision, effectively eliminating erroneous measurements and uncovering coherent structures within exceedingly noisy input amidst diverse real-world illumination scenarios. The framework comprises two core elements: a spike generation model incorporating an integrate-and-fire neuron layer and parameters accounting for non-idealities, such as threshold variation, and a spike rendering loss capable of generalizing across varying illumination conditions. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views from the novel continuous spike stream, demonstrating advantages over other vision sensors in certain scenes.

Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique.

However, the varied functionalities required by different 3D applications often necessitate diverse NeRF models with various pipelines, leading to tedious NeRF training for each target task and cumbersome trial-and-error experiments. Drawing inspiration from the generalization capability and adaptability of emerging foundation models, our work aims to develop one general-purpose NeRF for handling diverse 3D tasks. We achieve this by proposing a framework called Omni-Recon, which is capable of (1) generalizable 3D reconstruction and zero-shot multitask scene understanding, and (2) adaptability to diverse downstream 3D applications such as real-time rendering and scene editing. Our key insight is that an image-based rendering pipeline, with accurate geometry and appearance estimation, can lift 2D image features into their 3D counterparts, thus extending widely explored 2D tasks to the 3D world in a generalizable manner. Specifically, our Omni-Recon features a general-purpose NeRF model using image-based rendering with two decoupled branches: one complex transformer-based branch that progressively fuses geometry and appearance features for accurate geometry estimation, and one lightweight branch for predicting blending weights of source views. This design achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalizable 3D surface reconstruction quality with blending weights reusable across diverse tasks for zero-shot multitask scene understanding. In addition, it can enable real-time rendering after baking the complex geometry branch into meshes, swift adaptation to achieve SOTA generalizable 3D understanding performance, and seamless integration with 2D diffusion models for text-guided 3D editing. et.al.|[2403.11131](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11131)|null|
|**2024-03-16**|**Fast Sparse View Guided NeRF Update for Object Reconfigurations**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), as an implicit 3D scene representation, lacks inherent ability to accommodate changes made to the initial static scene. If objects are reconfigured, it is difficult to update the NeRF to reflect the new state of the scene without time-consuming data re-capturing and NeRF re-training. To address this limitation, we develop the first update method for NeRFs to physical changes. Our method takes only sparse new images (e.g. 4) of the altered scene as extra inputs and update the pre-trained NeRF in around 1 to 2 minutes. Particularly, we develop a pipeline to identify scene changes and update the NeRF accordingly. Our core idea is the use of a second helper NeRF to learn the local geometry and appearance changes, which sidesteps the optimization difficulties in direct NeRF fine-tuning. The interpolation power of the helper NeRF is the key to accurately reconstruct the un-occluded objects regions under sparse view supervision. Our method imposes no constraints on NeRF pre-training, and requires no extra user input or explicit semantic priors. It is an order of magnitude faster than re-training NeRF from scratch while maintaining on-par and even superior performance. et.al.|[2403.11024](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11024)|null|

Addressing this, we propose HourglassNeRF, an effective regularization-based approach with a novel hourglass casting strategy. Our proposed hourglass is conceptualized as a bundle of additional rays within the area between the original input ray and its corresponding reflection ray, by featurizing the conical frustum via Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE). This design expands the coverage of unseen views and enables an adaptive high-frequency regularization based on target pixel photo-consistency. Furthermore, we propose luminance consistency regularization based on the Lambertian assumption, which is known to be effective for training a set of augmented rays under the few-shot setting. Leveraging the inherent property of a Lambertian surface, which retains consistent luminance irrespective of the viewing angle, we assume our proposed hourglass as a collection of flipped diffuse reflection rays and enhance the luminance consistency between the original input ray and its corresponding hourglass, resulting in more physically grounded training framework and performance improvement. Our HourglassNeRF outperforms its baseline and achieves competitive results on multiple benchmarks with sharply rendered fine details.

However, panoramic images synthesized by traditional methods lack depth information and can only provide three degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) rotation rendering in virtual reality applications. To fully preserve and exploit the parallax information within the original fisheye cameras, we introduce MSI-NeRF, which combines deep learning omnidirectional depth estimation and novel view rendering. We first construct a multi-sphere image as a cost volume through feature extraction and warping of the input images. It is then processed by geometry and appearance decoders, respectively. Unlike methods that regress depth maps directly, we further build an implicit radiance field using spatial points and interpolated 3D feature vectors as input. In this way, we can simultaneously realize omnidirectional depth estimation and 6DoF view synthesis. Our method is trained in a semi-self-supervised manner. It does not require target view images and only uses depth data for supervision. Our network has the generalization ability to reconstruct unknown scenes efficiently using only four images.

However, these features often lack the spatial resolution to directly perform dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth prediction because models aggressively pool information over large areas. In this work, we introduce FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to restore lost spatial information in deep features. We introduce two variants of FeatUp: one that guides features with high-resolution signal in a single forward pass, and one that fits an implicit model to a single image to reconstruct features at any resolution. Both approaches use a multi-view consistency loss with deep analogies to NeRFs. Our features retain their original semantics and can be swapped into existing applications to yield resolution and performance gains even without re-training. We show that FeatUp significantly outperforms other feature upsampling and image super-resolution approaches in class activation map generation, transfer learning for segmentation and depth prediction, and end-to-end training for semantic segmentation. et.al.|[2403.10516](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10516)|**[link](https://github.com/mhamilton723/FeatUp)**|

However, the predominant reliance on RGB imaging presupposes ideal lighting conditions: a premise frequently unmet in robotic applications plagued by poor lighting or visual obstructions. This limitation overlooks the capabilities of infrared (IR) cameras, which excel in low-light detection and present a robust alternative under such adverse scenarios. To tackle these issues, we introduce Thermal-NeRF, the first method that estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF solely from IR imaging. By leveraging a thermal mapping and structural thermal constraint derived from the thermal characteristics of IR imaging, our method showcasing unparalleled proficiency in recovering NeRFs in visually degraded scenes where RGB-based methods fall short.

A recent innovation, keypoint scene coordinate regression (KSCR) named D2S addresses these issues by leveraging graph attention networks to enhance keypoint relationships and predict their 3D coordinates using a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP). Camera pose is then determined via PnP+RANSAC, using established 2D-3D correspondences. While KSCR achieves competitive results, rivaling state-of-the-art image-retrieval methods like HLoc across multiple benchmarks, its performance is hindered when data samples are limited due to the deep learning model's reliance on extensive data. This paper proposes a solution to this challenge by introducing a pipeline for keypoint descriptor synthesis using Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). By generating novel poses and feeding them into a trained NeRF model to create new views, our approach enhances the KSCR's generalization capabilities in data-scarce environments. The proposed system could significantly improve localization accuracy by up to 50\% and cost only a fraction of time for data synthesis. Furthermore, its modular design allows for the integration of multiple NeRFs, offering a versatile and efficient solution for visual localization.

Moreover, we implement a deferred back-propagation mechanism that enables high-resolution training and inference, overcoming the resolution constraints of previous methods. To enhance the speed and efficiency, we further introduce a progressive Gaussian cache module that dynamically adjusts during training and inference. As the first pose-free generalizable 3D-GS framework, GGRt achieves inference at $\ge$ 5 FPS and real-time rendering at $\ge$ 100 FPS. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing NeRF-based pose-free techniques in terms of inference speed and effectiveness. It can also approach the real pose-based 3D-GS methods. Our contributions provide a significant leap forward for the integration of computer vision and computer graphics into practical applications, offering state-of-the-art results on LLFF, KITTI, and Waymo Open datasets and enabling real-time rendering for immersive experiences. et.al.|[2403.10147](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10147)|null|
|**2024-03-15**|**URS-NeRF: Unordered Rolling Shutter Bundle Adjustment for Neural Radiance Fields**|We propose a novel rolling shutter bundle adjustment method for neural radiance fields (NeRF), which utilizes the unordered rolling shutter (RS) images to obtain the implicit 3D representation. Existing NeRF methods suffer from low-quality images and inaccurate initial camera poses due to the RS effect in the image, whereas, the previous method that incorporates the RS into NeRF requires strict sequential data input, limiting its widespread applicability. In constant, our method recovers the physical formation of RS images by estimating camera poses and velocities, thereby removing the input constraints on sequential data. Moreover, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training strategy, in which the RS epipolar constraints of the pairwise frames in the scene graph are used to detect the camera poses that fall into local minima. The poses detected as outliers are corrected by the interpolation method with neighboring poses. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art works and demonstrate that the reconstruction of 3D representations is not constrained by the requirement of video sequence input. et.al.|[2403.10119](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10119)|null|

However, these approaches rely on the assumption of sharp input images. When faced with motion blur, existing dynamic NeRF methods often struggle to generate high-quality novel views. In this paper, we propose DyBluRF, a dynamic radiance field approach that synthesizes sharp novel views from a monocular video affected by motion blur. To account for motion blur in input images, we simultaneously capture the camera trajectory and object Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories within the scene. Additionally, we employ a global cross-time rendering approach to ensure consistent temporal coherence across the entire scene. We curate a dataset comprising diverse dynamic scenes that are specifically tailored for our task. Experimental results on our dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in generating sharp novel views from motion-blurred inputs while maintaining spatial-temporal consistency of the scene. et.al.|[2403.10103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10103)|null|

Our aim is to contribute to the development of popular 3D scene reconstruction algorithms such as IBRnet, NeRF, and 3D Gaussian splitting. More importantly, the collected dataset, which is much denser than existing datasets, may also inspire space-oriented light field reconstruction, which is potentially different from object-centric 3D reconstruction, for immersive VR/AR experiences. We utilized a total of 40 GoPro 10 cameras, capturing images of 5k resolution. The number of photos captured for each scene is no less than 1000, and the average density (view number within a unit sphere) is 134.68. It is also worth noting that our system is capable of efficiently capturing large outdoor scenes. Addressing the current lack of large-space and dense light field datasets, we made efforts to include elements such as sky, reflections, lights and shadows that are of interest to researchers in the field of 3D reconstruction during the data capture process. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of our provided dataset on three popular algorithms and also integrated the reconstructed 3DGS results into the Unity engine, demonstrating the potential of utilizing our datasets to enhance the realism of virtual reality (VR) and create feasible interactive spaces.

Such technology facilitates robots in executing object manipulations based on human language directives. To tackle this challenge, some research efforts have been dedicated to the development of language-embedded implicit fields. However, implicit fields (e.g. NeRF) encounter limitations due to the necessity of processing a large number of input views for reconstruction, coupled with their inherent inefficiencies in inference. Thus, we present the GaussianGrasper, which utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to explicitly represent the scene as a collection of Gaussian primitives. Our approach takes a limited set of RGB-D views and employs a tile-based splatting technique to create a feature field. In particular, we propose an Efficient Feature Distillation (EFD) module that employs contrastive learning to efficiently and accurately distill language embeddings derived from foundational models. With the reconstructed geometry of the Gaussian field, our method enables the pre-trained grasping model to generate collision-free grasp pose candidates. Furthermore, we propose a normal-guided grasp module to select the best grasp pose. Through comprehensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that GaussianGrasper enables robots to accurately query and grasp objects with language instructions, providing a new solution for language-guided manipulation tasks.

|**2024-03-14**|**The NeRFect Match: Exploring NeRF Features for Visual Localization**|In this work, we propose the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a scene representation for visual localization. Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks. et.al.|[2403.09577](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09577)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**VIRUS-NeRF -- Vision, InfraRed and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields**|Autonomous mobile robots are an increasingly integral part of modern factory and warehouse operations. Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

|**2024-03-14**|**3D-SceneDreamer: Text-Driven 3D-Consistent Scene Generation**|Text-driven 3D scene generation techniques have made rapid progress in recent years. Their success is mainly attributed to using existing generative models to iteratively perform image warping and inpainting to generate 3D scenes. However, these methods heavily rely on the outputs of existing models, leading to error accumulation in geometry and appearance that prevent the models from being used in various scenarios (e.g., outdoor and unreal scenarios). To address this limitation, we generatively refine the newly generated local views by querying and aggregating global 3D information, and then progressively generate the 3D scene. Specifically, we employ a tri-plane features-based NeRF as a unified representation of the 3D scene to constrain global 3D consistency, and propose a generative refinement network to synthesize new contents with higher quality by exploiting the natural image prior from 2D diffusion model as well as the global 3D information of the current scene. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to previous methods, our approach supports wide variety of scene generation and arbitrary camera trajectories with improved visual quality and 3D consistency. et.al.|[2403.09439](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09439)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**RoDUS: Robust Decomposition of Static and Dynamic Elements in Urban Scenes**|The task of separating dynamic objects from static environments using NeRFs has been widely studied in recent years. However, capturing large-scale scenes still poses a challenge due to their complex geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics. Without the help of 3D motion cues, previous methods often require simplified setups with slow camera motion and only a few/single dynamic actors, leading to suboptimal solutions in most urban setups. To overcome such limitations, we present RoDUS, a pipeline for decomposing static and dynamic elements in urban scenes, with thoughtfully separated NeRF models for moving and non-moving components. Our approach utilizes a robust kernel-based initialization coupled with 4D semantic information to selectively guide the learning process. This strategy enables accurate capturing of the dynamics in the scene, resulting in reduced artifacts caused by NeRF on background reconstruction, all by using self-supervision. Notably, experimental evaluations on KITTI-360 and Pandaset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in decomposing challenging urban scenes into precise static and dynamic components. et.al.|[2403.09419](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09419)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**PreSight: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception with City-Scale NeRF Priors**|Autonomous vehicles rely extensively on perception systems to navigate and interpret their surroundings. Despite significant advancements in these systems recently, challenges persist under conditions like occlusion, extreme lighting, or in unfamiliar urban areas. Unlike these systems, humans do not solely depend on immediate observations to perceive the environment. In navigating new cities, humans gradually develop a preliminary mental map to supplement real-time perception during subsequent visits. Inspired by this human approach, we introduce a novel framework, Pre-Sight, that leverages past traversals to construct static prior memories, enhancing online perception in later navigations. Our method involves optimizing a city-scale neural radiance field with data from previous journeys to generate neural priors. These priors, rich in semantic and geometric details, are derived without manual annotations and can seamlessly augment various state-of-the-art perception models, improving their efficacy with minimal additional computational cost. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the framework's high compatibility with diverse online perception models. Specifically, it shows remarkable improvements in HD-map construction and occupancy prediction tasks, highlighting its potential as a new perception framework for autonomous driving systems.

|**2024-03-13**|**Gaussian Splatting in Style**|Scene stylization extends the work of neural style transfer to three spatial dimensions. A vital challenge in this problem is to maintain the uniformity of the stylized appearance across a multi-view setting. A vast majority of the previous works achieve this by optimizing the scene with a specific style image. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture trained on a collection of style images, that at test time produces high quality stylized novel views. Our work builds up on the framework of 3D Gaussian splatting. For a given scene, we take the pretrained Gaussians and process them using a multi resolution hash grid and a tiny MLP to obtain the conditional stylised views. The explicit nature of 3D Gaussians give us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods including geometric consistency, along with having a fast training and rendering regime. This enables our method to be useful for vast practical use cases such as in augmented or virtual reality applications. Through our experiments, we show our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance with superior visual quality on various indoor and outdoor real-world data. et.al.|[2403.08498](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08498)|null|
|**2024-03-13**|**StyleDyRF: Zero-shot 4D Style Transfer for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields**|4D style transfer aims at transferring arbitrary visual style to the synthesized novel views of a dynamic 4D scene with varying viewpoints and times. Existing efforts on 3D style transfer can effectively combine the visual features of style images and neural radiance fields (NeRF) but fail to handle the 4D dynamic scenes limited by the static scene assumption. Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer. The experimental results show that our method not only renders 4D photorealistic style transfer results in a zero-shot manner but also outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency. et.al.|[2403.08310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08310)|null|

This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for realistic multi-view training data generation. We create a diverse multi-view dataset using NeRFs, consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors to train on NeRF-synthesised views supervised by perspective projective geometry.

|**2024-03-12**|**Q-SLAM: Quadric Representations for Monocular SLAM**|Monocular SLAM has long grappled with the challenge of accurately modeling 3D geometries. Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based monocular SLAM have shown promise, yet these methods typically focus on novel view synthesis rather than precise 3D geometry modeling. This focus results in a significant disconnect between NeRF applications, i.e., novel-view synthesis and the requirements of SLAM. We identify that the gap results from the volumetric representations used in NeRF, which are often dense and noisy. In this study, we propose a novel approach that reimagines volumetric representations through the lens of quadric forms. We posit that most scene components can be effectively represented as quadric planes. Leveraging this assumption, we reshape the volumetric representations with million of cubes by several quadric planes, which leads to more accurate and efficient modeling of 3D scenes in SLAM contexts. Our method involves two key steps: First, we use the quadric assumption to enhance coarse depth estimations obtained from tracking modules, e.g., Droid-SLAM. This step alone significantly improves depth estimation accuracy. Second, in the subsequent mapping phase, we diverge from previous NeRF-based SLAM methods that distribute sampling points across the entire volume space. Instead, we concentrate sampling points around quadric planes and aggregate them using a novel quadric-decomposed Transformer. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end joint optimization strategy that synchronizes pose estimation with 3D reconstruction. et.al.|[2403.08125](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08125)|null|
|**2024-03-12**|**SMURF: Continuous Dynamics for Motion-Deblurring Radiance Fields**|Neural radiance fields (NeRF) has attracted considerable attention for their exceptional ability in synthesizing novel views with high fidelity. However, the presence of motion blur, resulting from slight camera movements during extended shutter exposures, poses a significant challenge, potentially compromising the quality of the reconstructed 3D scenes. While recent studies have addressed this issue, they do not consider the continuous dynamics of camera movements during image acquisition, leading to inaccurate scene reconstruction. Additionally, these methods are plagued by slow training and rendering speed. To effectively handle these issues, we propose sequential motion understanding radiance fields (SMURF), a novel approach that employs neural ordinary differential equation (Neural-ODE) to model continuous camera motion and leverages the explicit volumetric representation method for faster training and robustness to motion-blurred input images. The core idea of the SMURF is continuous motion blurring kernel (CMBK), a unique module designed to model a continuous camera movements for processing blurry inputs.

We exploit the trajectory from a real-time lidar SLAM system to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) procedure to both significantly reduce the computation time and to provide metric scale which is crucial for lidar depth loss. We use submapping to scale the system to large-scale environments captured over long trajectories.

|**2024-03-11**|**Vosh: Voxel-Mesh Hybrid Representation for Real-Time View Synthesis**|The neural radiance field (NeRF) has emerged as a prominent methodology for synthesizing realistic images of novel views. While neural radiance representations based on voxels or mesh individually offer distinct advantages, excelling in either rendering quality or speed, each has limitations in the other aspect. In response, we propose a pioneering hybrid representation named Vosh, seamlessly combining both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering for view synthesis. Vosh is meticulously crafted by optimizing the voxel grid of NeRF, strategically with selected voxels replaced by mesh. Therefore, it excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on flexible usage. Experimental results demonstrates that our method achieves commendable trade-off between rendering quality and speed, and notably has real-time performance on mobile devices. et.al.|[2403.06505](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06505)|null|

However, Nerf models overfit on a single scene, lacking generalization to out of distribution objects. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited remarkable performance on introducing generalization in view synthesis. Inspired by these advancements, we explore the capabilities of a pretrained stable diffusion model for view synthesis without explicit 3D priors. Specifically, we base our method on a personalized text to image model, Dreambooth, given its strong ability to adapt to specific novel objects with a few shots. Our research reveals two interesting findings. First, we observe that Dreambooth can learn the high level concept of a view, compared to arguably more complex strategies which involve finetuning diffusions on large amounts of multi-view data. Second, we establish that the concept of a view can be disentangled and transferred to a novel object irrespective of the original object's identify from which the views are learnt. Motivated by this, we introduce a learning strategy, FSViewFusion, which inherits a specific view through only one image sample of a single scene, and transfers the knowledge to a novel object, learnt from few shots, using low rank adapters. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method, albeit simple, is efficient in generating reliable view samples for in the wild images.

|**2024-03-10**|**Is Vanilla MLP in Neural Radiance Field Enough for Few-shot View Synthesis?**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved superior performance for novel view synthesis by modeling the scene with a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and a volume rendering procedure, however, when fewer known views are given (i.e., few-shot view synthesis), the model is prone to overfit the given views. To handle this issue, previous efforts have been made towards leveraging learned priors or introducing additional regularizations. In contrast, in this paper, we for the first time provide an orthogonal method from the perspective of network structure. Given the observation that trivially reducing the number of model parameters alleviates the overfitting issue, but at the cost of missing details, we propose the multi-input MLP (mi-MLP) that incorporates the inputs (i.e., location and viewing direction) of the vanilla MLP into each layer to prevent the overfitting issue without harming detailed synthesis. To further reduce the artifacts, we propose to model colors and volume density separately and present two regularization terms. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that: 1) although the proposed mi-MLP is easy to implement, it is surprisingly effective as it boosts the PSNR of the baseline from $14.73$ to $24.23$ . 2) the overall framework achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.

However, there are several challenges posed when performing SC in 3D scenarios: 1) 3D semantic extraction; 2) Latent semantic redundancy; and 3) Uncertain channel estimation. To address these issues, we propose a Generative AI Model assisted 3D SC (GAM-3DSC) system. Firstly, we introduce a 3D Semantic Extractor (3DSE), which employs generative AI models, including Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), to extract key semantics from a 3D scenario based on user requirements. The extracted 3D semantics are represented as multi-perspective images of the goal-oriented 3D object. Then, we present an Adaptive Semantic Compression Model (ASCM) for encoding these multi-perspective images, in which we use a semantic encoder with two output heads to perform semantic encoding and mask redundant semantics in the latent semantic space, respectively. Next, we design a conditional Generative adversarial network and Diffusion model aided-Channel Estimation (GDCE) to estimate and refine the Channel State Information (CSI) of physical channels. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed GAM-3DSC system in effectively transmitting the goal-oriented 3D scenario. et.al.|[2403.05783](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05783)|null|

We tackle the problem by leveraging Gaussian splatting to represent 3D scenes, and we optimize the model while progressively varying the image supervision by means of a pretrained image-based diffusion model. The input object may be given as a 3D triangular mesh, or directly provided as Gaussians from a generative model such as DreamGaussian. GSEdit ensures consistency across different viewpoints, maintaining the integrity of the original object's information. Compared to previously proposed methods relying on NeRF-like MLP models, GSEdit stands out for its efficiency, making 3D editing tasks much faster.

Despite the huge interest in NeRF methods, a practical use case of NeRFs has largely been ignored; the exploration of the scene space modelled by a NeRF. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we propose and formally define the scene exploration framework as the efficient discovery of NeRF model inputs (i.e. coordinates and viewing angles), using which one can render novel views that adhere to user-selected criteria. To remedy the lack of approaches addressing scene exploration, we first propose two baseline methods called Guided-Random Search (GRS) and Pose Interpolation-based Search (PIBS). We then cast scene exploration as an optimization problem, and propose the criteria-agnostic Evolution-Guided Pose Search (EGPS) for efficient exploration. We test all three approaches with various criteria (e.g. saliency maximization, image quality maximization, photo-composition quality improvement) and show that our EGPS performs more favourably than other baselines. We finally highlight key points and limitations, and outline directions for future research in scene exploration. et.al.|[2403.04508](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04508)|null|

When rendering novel view X-ray projections, existing methods mainly based on NeRF suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework, namely X-Gaussian, for X-ray novel view synthesis. Firstly, we redesign a radiative Gaussian point cloud model inspired by the isotropic nature of X-ray imaging. Our model excludes the influence of view direction when learning to predict the radiation intensity of 3D points. Based on this model, we develop a Differentiable Radiative Rasterization (DRR) with CUDA implementation. Secondly, we customize an Angle-pose Cuboid Uniform Initialization (ACUI) strategy that directly uses the parameters of the X-ray scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying less than 15% training time and over 73x inference speed.

|**2024-03-07**|**Closing the Visual Sim-to-Real Gap with Object-Composable NeRFs**|Deep learning methods for perception are the cornerstone of many robotic systems. Despite their potential for impressive performance, obtaining real-world training data is expensive, and can be impractically difficult for some tasks. Sim-to-real transfer with domain randomization offers a potential workaround, but often requires extensive manual tuning and results in models that are brittle to distribution shift between sim and real. In this work, we introduce Composable Object Volume NeRF (COV-NeRF), an object-composable NeRF model that is the centerpiece of a real-to-sim pipeline for synthesizing training data targeted to scenes and objects from the real world. COV-NeRF extracts objects from real images and composes them into new scenes, generating photorealistic renderings and many types of 2D and 3D supervision, including depth maps, segmentation masks, and meshes. We show that COV-NeRF matches the rendering quality of modern NeRF methods, and can be used to rapidly close the sim-to-real gap across a variety of perceptual modalities. et.al.|[2403.04114](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04114)|**[link](https://github.com/nikhilmishra000/cov-nerf)**|
|**2024-03-06**|**GSNeRF: Generalizable Semantic Neural Radiance Fields with Enhanced 3D Scene Understanding**|Utilizing multi-view inputs to synthesize novel-view images, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a popular research topic in 3D vision. In this work, we introduce a Generalizable Semantic Neural Radiance Field (GSNeRF), which uniquely takes image semantics into the synthesis process so that both novel view images and the associated semantic maps can be produced for unseen scenes. Our GSNeRF is composed of two stages: Semantic Geo-Reasoning and Depth-Guided Visual rendering. The former is able to observe multi-view image inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the resulting image geometry information, the latter performs both image and semantic rendering with improved performances. Our experiments not only confirm that GSNeRF performs favorably against prior works on both novel-view image and semantic segmentation synthesis but the effectiveness of our sampling strategy for visual rendering is further verified. et.al.|[2403.03608](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03608)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**A Deep Learning Framework for Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction and Channel Prediction**|We present NeWRF, a deep learning framework for predicting wireless channels. Wireless channel prediction is a long-standing problem in the wireless community and is a key technology for improving the coverage of wireless network deployments. Today, a wireless deployment is evaluated by a site survey which is a cumbersome process requiring an experienced engineer to perform extensive channel measurements. To reduce the cost of site surveys, we develop NeWRF, which is based on recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). NeWRF trains a neural network model with a sparse set of channel measurements, and predicts the wireless channel accurately at any location in the site. We introduce a series of techniques that integrate wireless propagation properties into the NeRF framework to account for the fundamental differences between the behavior of light and wireless signals. We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework and show that our approach can accurately predict channels at unvisited locations with significantly lower measurement density than prior state-of-the-art et.al.|[2403.03241](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03241)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**Splat-Nav: Safe Real-Time Robot Navigation in Gaussian Splatting Maps**|We present Splat-Nav, a navigation pipeline that consists of a real-time safe planning module and a robust state estimation module designed to operate in the Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) environment representation, a popular emerging 3D scene representation from computer vision. We formulate rigorous collision constraints that can be computed quickly to build a guaranteed-safe polytope corridor through the map. We then optimize a B-spline trajectory through this corridor. We also develop a real-time, robust state estimation module by interpreting the GSplat representation as a point cloud. The module enables the robot to localize its global pose with zero prior knowledge from RGB-D images using point cloud alignment, and then track its own pose as it moves through the scene from RGB images using image-to-point cloud localization. We also incorporate semantics into the GSplat in order to obtain better images for localization. All of these modules operate mainly on CPU, freeing up GPU resources for tasks like real-time scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline in both simulation and hardware, where we show re-planning at 5 Hz and pose estimation at 20 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation. et.al.|[2403.02751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02751)|null|
|**2024-03-04**|**DaReNeRF: Direction-aware Representation for Dynamic Scenes**|Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit representations. However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared to prior art while delivering superior performance. et.al.|[2403.02265](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02265)|null|
|**2024-03-04**|**Depth-Guided Robust and Fast Point Cloud Fusion NeRF for Sparse Input Views**|Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view, characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines. et.al.|[2403.02063](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02063)|null|
|**2024-03-02**|**NeRF-VPT: Learning Novel View Representations with Neural Radiance Fields via View Prompt Tuning**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have garnered remarkable success in novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, the task of generating high-quality images for novel views persists as a critical challenge. While the existing efforts have exhibited commendable progress, capturing intricate details, enhancing textures, and achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics warrant further focused attention and advancement. In this work, we propose NeRF-VPT, an innovative method for novel view synthesis to address these challenges. Our proposed NeRF-VPT employs a cascading view prompt tuning paradigm, wherein RGB information gained from preceding rendering outcomes serves as instructive visual prompts for subsequent rendering stages, with the aspiration that the prior knowledge embedded in the prompts can facilitate the gradual enhancement of rendered image quality. NeRF-VPT only requires sampling RGB data from previous stage renderings as priors at each training stage, without relying on extra guidance or complex techniques. Thus, our NeRF-VPT is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing methods. By conducting comparative analyses of our NeRF-VPT against several NeRF-based approaches on demanding real-scene benchmarks, such as Realistic Synthetic 360, Real Forward-Facing, Replica dataset, and a user-captured dataset, we substantiate that our NeRF-VPT significantly elevates baseline performance and proficiently generates more high-quality novel view images than all the compared state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the cascading learning of NeRF-VPT introduces adaptability to scenarios with sparse inputs, resulting in a significant enhancement of accuracy for sparse-view novel view synthesis.

|**2024-03-02**|**Neural radiance fields-based holography [Invited]**|This study presents a novel approach for generating holograms based on the neural radiance fields (NeRF) technique. Generating three-dimensional (3D) data is difficult in hologram computation. NeRF is a state-of-the-art technique for 3D light-field reconstruction from 2D images based on volume rendering. The NeRF can rapidly predict new-view images that do not include a training dataset. In this study, we constructed a rendering pipeline directly from a 3D light field generated from 2D images by NeRF for hologram generation using deep neural networks within a reasonable time. The pipeline comprises three main components: the NeRF, a depth predictor, and a hologram generator, all constructed using deep neural networks. The pipeline does not include any physical calculations. The predicted holograms of a 3D scene viewed from any direction were computed using the proposed pipeline.

|**2024-03-02**|**Neural Field Classifiers via Target Encoding and Classification Loss**|Neural field methods have seen great progress in various long-standing tasks in computer vision and computer graphics, including novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction. As existing neural field methods try to predict some coordinate-based continuous target values, such as RGB for Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), all of these methods are regression models and are optimized by some regression loss. However, are regression models really better than classification models for neural field methods? In this work, we try to visit this very fundamental but overlooked question for neural fields from a machine learning perspective. We successfully propose a novel Neural Field Classifier (NFC) framework which formulates existing neural field methods as classification tasks rather than regression tasks. The proposed NFC can easily transform arbitrary Neural Field Regressor (NFR) into its classification variant via employing a novel Target Encoding module and optimizing a classification loss. By encoding a continuous regression target into a high-dimensional discrete encoding, we naturally formulate a multi-label classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness of NFC at the nearly free extra computational costs. Moreover, NFC also shows robustness to sparse inputs, corrupted images, and dynamic scenes. et.al.|[2403.01058](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01058)|null|

We leverage on-device SLAM systems to generate posed keyframes and transmit them to remote servers that can perform high quality 3D reconstruction and visualization at runtime by leveraging NeRF models. We identify a key challenge with online NeRF training where naive image sampling strategies can lead to significant degradation in rendering quality. We propose a novel shifted exponential frame sampling method that addresses this challenge for online NeRF training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling high-quality real-time reconstruction and visualization of unknown scenes as they are captured and streamed from cameras in mobile robots and edge devices. et.al.|[2403.00228](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00228)|null|

However, the availability of datasets capturing this viewpoint is extremely limited, especially those with high-quality 2D and 3D keypoint annotations. Addressing this gap, we leverage the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technique to establish a comprehensive pipeline for generating human pose datasets from existing 2D and 3D datasets, specifically tailored for the top-view fisheye perspective. Through this pipeline, we create a novel dataset NToP570K (NeRF-powered Top-view human Pose dataset for fisheye cameras with over 570 thousand images), and conduct an extensive evaluation of its efficacy in enhancing neural networks for 2D and 3D top-view human pose estimation. A pretrained ViTPose-B model achieves an improvement in AP of 33.3 % on our validation set for 2D HPE after finetuning on our training set. A similarly finetuned HybrIK-Transformer model gains 53.7 mm reduction in PA-MPJPE for 3D HPE on the validation set. et.al.|[2402.18196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18196)|null|

|**2024-02-27**|**Diffusion Meets DAgger: Supercharging Eye-in-hand Imitation Learning**|A common failure mode for policies trained with imitation is compounding execution errors at test time. When the learned policy encounters states that were not present in the expert demonstrations, the policy fails, leading to degenerate behavior. The Dataset Aggregation, or DAgger approach to this problem simply collects more data to cover these failure states. However, in practice, this is often prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose Diffusion Meets DAgger (DMD), a method to reap the benefits of DAgger without the cost for eye-in-hand imitation learning problems. Instead of collecting new samples to cover out-of-distribution states, DMD uses recent advances in diffusion models to create these samples with diffusion models. This leads to robust performance from few demonstrations. In experiments conducted for non-prehensile pushing on a Franka Research 3, we show that DMD can achieve a success rate of 80% with as few as 8 expert demonstrations, where naive behavior cloning reaches only 20%. DMD also outperform competing NeRF-based augmentation schemes by 50%. et.al.|[2402.17768](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17768)|null|

While the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting works well on small-scale and object-centric scenes, scaling it up to large scenes poses challenges due to limited video memory, long optimization time, and noticeable appearance variations. To address these challenges, we present VastGaussian, the first method for high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering on large scenes based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We propose a progressive partitioning strategy to divide a large scene into multiple cells, where the training cameras and point cloud are properly distributed with an airspace-aware visibility criterion. These cells are merged into a complete scene after parallel optimization. We also introduce decoupled appearance modeling into the optimization process to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images. Our approach outperforms existing NeRF-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple large scene datasets, enabling fast optimization and high-fidelity real-time rendering. et.al.|[2402.17427](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17427)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**Learning Dynamic Tetrahedra for High-Quality Talking Head Synthesis**|Recent works in implicit representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have advanced the generation of realistic and animatable head avatars from video sequences. These implicit methods are still confronted by visual artifacts and jitters, since the lack of explicit geometric constraints poses a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling complex facial deformations. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Tetrahedra (DynTet), a novel hybrid representation that encodes explicit dynamic meshes by neural networks to ensure geometric consistency across various motions and viewpoints. DynTet is parameterized by the coordinate-based networks which learn signed distance, deformation, and material texture, anchoring the training data into a predefined tetrahedra grid. Leveraging Marching Tetrahedra, DynTet efficiently decodes textured meshes with a consistent topology, enabling fast rendering through a differentiable rasterizer and supervision via a pixel loss. To enhance training efficiency, we incorporate classical 3D Morphable Models to facilitate geometry learning and define a canonical space for simplifying texture learning. These advantages are readily achievable owing to the effective geometric representation employed in DynTet. Compared with prior works, DynTet demonstrates significant improvements in fidelity, lip synchronization, and real-time performance according to various metrics. Beyond producing stable and visually appealing synthesis videos, our method also outputs the dynamic meshes which is promising to enable many emerging applications. et.al.|[2402.17364](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17364)|**[link](https://github.com/zhangzc21/dyntet)**|

However, most existing work remains constrained by limited diversity, producing avatars with subtle differences in appearance for a given text prompt. We design DivAvatar, a novel framework that generates diverse avatars, empowering 3D creatives with a multitude of distinct and richly varied 3D avatars from a single text prompt. Different from most existing work that exploits scene-specific 3D representations such as NeRF, DivAvatar finetunes a 3D generative model (i.e., EVA3D), allowing diverse avatar generation from simply noise sampling in inference time. DivAvatar has two key designs that help achieve generation diversity and visual quality. The first is a noise sampling technique during training phase which is critical in generating diverse appearances. The second is a semantic-aware zoom mechanism and a novel depth loss, the former producing appearances of high textual fidelity by separate fine-tuning of specific body parts and the latter improving geometry quality greatly by smoothing the generated mesh in the features space. Extensive experiments show that DivAvatar is highly versatile in generating avatars of diverse appearances. et.al.|[2402.17292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17292)|null|

However, the process is often time-consuming and demands a high level of skill. In this paper, we present a novel approach to create volumetric representations of 3D characters from consistent turnaround concept art, which serves as the standard input in the 3D modeling industry. While Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has been a game-changer in image-based 3D reconstruction, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known research that optimizes the pipeline for concept art. To harness the potential of concept art, with its defined body poses and specific view angles, we propose encoding it as priors for our model. We train the network to make use of these priors for various 3D points through a learnable view-direction-attended multi-head self-attention layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that a combination of ray sampling and surface sampling enhances the inference capabilities of our network. Our model is able to generate high-quality 360-degree views of characters. Subsequently, we provide a simple guideline to better leverage our model to extract the 3D mesh. It is important to note that our model's inferencing capabilities are influenced by the training data's characteristics, primarily focusing on characters with a single head, two arms, and two legs. Nevertheless, our methodology remains versatile and adaptable to concept art from diverse subject matters, without imposing any specific assumptions on the data. et.al.|[2402.17115](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17115)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**Disentangled 3D Scene Generation with Layout Learning**|We introduce a method to generate 3D scenes that are disentangled into their component objects. This disentanglement is unsupervised, relying only on the knowledge of a large pretrained text-to-image model. Our key insight is that objects can be discovered by finding parts of a 3D scene that, when rearranged spatially, still produce valid configurations of the same scene. Concretely, our method jointly optimizes multiple NeRFs from scratch - each representing its own object - along with a set of layouts that composite these objects into scenes. We then encourage these composited scenes to be in-distribution according to the image generator. We show that despite its simplicity, our approach successfully generates 3D scenes decomposed into individual objects, enabling new capabilities in text-to-3D content creation.

|**2024-02-26**|**CMC: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis via Cross-view Multiplane Consistency**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive results in novel view synthesis, particularly in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), thanks to its ability to represent scenes continuously. However, when just a few input view images are available, NeRF tends to overfit the given views and thus make the estimated depths of pixels share almost the same value. Unlike previous methods that conduct regularization by introducing complex priors or additional supervisions, we propose a simple yet effective method that explicitly builds depth-aware consistency across input views to tackle this challenge. Our key insight is that by forcing the same spatial points to be sampled repeatedly in different input views, we are able to strengthen the interactions between views and therefore alleviate the overfitting problem. To achieve this, we build the neural networks on layered representations (\textit{i.e.}, multiplane images), and the sampling point can thus be resampled on multiple discrete planes. Furthermore, to regularize the unseen target views, we constrain the rendered colors and depths from different input views to be the same. Although simple, extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better synthesis quality over state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2402.16407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16407)|null|

However, the EVG representation is not efficient for storage and transmission because of the terrific memory cost. Current methods for compressing EVG mainly inherit the methods designed for neural network compression, such as pruning and quantization, which do not take full advantage of the spatial correlation of voxels. Inspired by prosperous digital image compression techniques, this paper proposes SPC-NeRF, a novel framework applying spatial predictive coding in EVG compression. The proposed framework can remove spatial redundancy efficiently for better compression performance.Moreover, we model the bitrate and design a novel form of the loss function, where we can jointly optimize compression ratio and distortion to achieve higher coding efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve 32% bit saving compared to the state-of-the-art method VQRF on multiple representative test datasets, with comparable training time. et.al.|[2402.16366](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16366)|null|

Current methods for scene understanding typically rely on a combination of trained models paired with either an explicit or learnt volumetric representation, all of which have their own drawbacks and limitations.

DreamUp3D is a self-supervised model, trained end-to-end, and is capable of segmenting objects, providing 3D object reconstructions, generating object-centric latent representations and accurate per-object 6D pose estimates. We compare DreamUp3D to baselines including NeRFs, pre-trained CLIP-features, ObSurf, and ObPose, in a range of tasks including 3D scene reconstruction, object matching and object pose estimation. Our experiments show that our model outperforms all baselines by a significant margin in real-world scenarios displaying its applicability for 3D scene understanding tasks while meeting the strict demands exhibited in robotics applications. et.al.|[2402.16308](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16308)|null|
|**2024-02-22**|**Consolidating Attention Features for Multi-view Image Editing**|Large-scale text-to-image models enable a wide range of image editing techniques, using text prompts or even spatial controls. However, applying these editing methods to multi-view images depicting a single scene leads to 3D-inconsistent results. In this work, we focus on spatial control-based geometric manipulations and introduce a method to consolidate the editing process across various views. We build on two insights: (1) maintaining consistent features throughout the generative process helps attain consistency in multi-view editing, and (2) the queries in self-attention layers significantly influence the image structure. Hence, we propose to improve the geometric consistency of the edited images by enforcing the consistency of the queries. To do so, we introduce QNeRF, a neural radiance field trained on the internal query features of the edited images. Once trained, QNeRF can render 3D-consistent queries, which are then softly injected back into the self-attention layers during generation, greatly improving multi-view consistency. We refine the process through a progressive, iterative method that better consolidates queries across the diffusion timesteps. We compare our method to a range of existing techniques and demonstrate that it can achieve better multi-view consistency and higher fidelity to the input scene. These advantages allow us to train NeRFs with fewer visual artifacts, that are better aligned with the target geometry. et.al.|[2402.14792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14792)|null|

The training stability of fast high-fidelity models is typically constrained to dense views, making them unsuitable for few-shot novel view synthesis tasks. To address this limitation, we utilize a regularization model as a data generator to produce dense views from sparse inputs, facilitating subsequent training of fast high-fidelity models. Since these dense views are pseudo ground truth generated by the regularization model, original sparse images are then used to fine-tune the fast high-fidelity model. This process helps the model learn realistic details and correct artifacts introduced in earlier stages. By leveraging an off-the-shelf regularization model and a fast high-fidelity model, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets. et.al.|[2402.14586](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14586)|null|

Despite its notable performance, we uncover three decisive shortcomings in its current design, including semantic ambiguity, inappropriate sampling, and insufficient utilization of depth supervision. To combat the aforementioned problems, we present three corresponding solutions: 1) Semantic Enhancement. We project the freely available 3D segmentation annotations onto the 2D plane and leverage the corresponding 2D semantic maps as the supervision signal, significantly enhancing the semantic awareness of multi-view detectors. 2) Perspective-aware Sampling. Instead of employing the uniform sampling strategy, we put forward the perspective-aware sampling policy that samples densely near the camera while sparsely in the distance, more effectively collecting the valuable geometric clues. 3)Ordinal Residual Depth Supervision. As opposed to directly regressing the depth values that are difficult to optimize, we divide the depth range of each scene into a fixed number of ordinal bins and reformulate the depth prediction as the combination of the classification of depth bins as well as the regression of the residual depth values, thereby benefiting the depth learning process. The resulting algorithm, NeRF-Det++, has exhibited appealing performance in the ScanNetV2 and ARKITScenes datasets. Notably, in ScanNetV2, NeRF-Det++ outperforms the competitive NeRF-Det by +1.9% in mAP@0.25 and +3.5% in mAP@0.50$.

Recently, a series of efforts have been devoted to accelerating the speed and improving the quality of the coordinate-based implicit field learning. Instead of learning heavy MLPs to predict the neural implicit values for the query coordinates, neural voxels or grids combined with shallow MLPs have been proposed to achieve high-quality implicit field learning with reduced optimization time. On the other hand, lightweight field representations such as linear grid have been proposed to further improve the learning speed. In this paper, we aim for both fast and high-quality implicit field learning, and propose TaylorGrid, a novel implicit field representation which can be efficiently computed via direct Taylor expansion optimization on 2D or 3D grids. As a general representation, TaylorGrid can be adapted to different implicit fields learning tasks such as SDF learning or NeRF. From extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons, TaylorGrid achieves a balance between the linear grid and neural voxels, showing its superiority in fast and high-quality implicit field learning. et.al.|[2402.14415](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14415)|null|

The recently proposed mip-NeRF has addressed this challenge by rendering conical frustums instead of rays. However, it relies on MLP architecture to represent the radiance fields, missing out on the fast training speed offered by the latest grid-based methods. In this work, we present mip-Grid, a novel approach that integrates anti-aliasing techniques into grid-based representations for radiance fields, mitigating the aliasing artifacts while enjoying fast training time. The proposed method generates multi-scale grids by applying simple convolution operations over a shared grid representation and uses the scale-aware coordinate to retrieve features at different scales from the generated multi-scale grids. To test the effectiveness, we integrated the proposed method into the two recent representative grid-based methods, TensoRF and K-Planes. Experimental results demonstrate that mip-Grid greatly improves the rendering performance of both methods and even outperforms mip-NeRF on multi-scale datasets while achieving significantly faster training time.

|**2024-02-21**|**Identifying Unnecessary 3D Gaussians using Clustering for Fast Rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting**|3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) is a new rendering approach that outperforms the neural radiance field (NeRF) in terms of both speed and image quality. 3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality. This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, the proposed technique excludes 63% of 3D Gaussians on average before the 2D image projection, which reduces the overall rendering computation by almost 38.3% without sacrificing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). The proposed accelerator also achieves a speedup of 10.7x compared to a GPU. et.al.|[2402.13827](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13827)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**SealD-NeRF: Interactive Pixel-Level Editing for Dynamic Scenes by Neural Radiance Fields**|The widespread adoption of implicit neural representations, especially Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), highlights a growing need for editing capabilities in implicit 3D models, essential for tasks like scene post-processing and 3D content creation. Despite previous efforts in NeRF editing, challenges remain due to limitations in editing flexibility and quality. The key issue is developing a neural representation that supports local edits for real-time updates. Current NeRF editing methods, offering pixel-level adjustments or detailed geometry and color modifications, are mostly limited to static scenes. This paper introduces SealD-NeRF, an extension of Seal-3D for pixel-level editing in dynamic settings, specifically targeting the D-NeRF network. It allows for consistent edits across sequences by mapping editing actions to a specific timeframe, freezing the deformation network responsible for dynamic scene representation, and using a teacher-student approach to integrate changes. et.al.|[2402.13510](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13510)|null|

|**2024-02-20**|**Improving Robustness for Joint Optimization of Camera Poses and Decomposed Low-Rank Tensorial Radiance Fields**|In this paper, we propose an algorithm that allows joint refinement of camera pose and scene geometry represented by decomposed low-rank tensor, using only 2D images as supervision. First, we conduct a pilot study based on a 1D signal and relate our findings to 3D scenarios, where the naive joint pose optimization on voxel-based NeRFs can easily lead to sub-optimal solutions. Moreover, based on the analysis of the frequency spectrum, we propose to apply convolutional Gaussian filters on 2D and 3D radiance fields for a coarse-to-fine training schedule that enables joint camera pose optimization. Leveraging the decomposition property in decomposed low-rank tensor, our method achieves an equivalent effect to brute-force 3D convolution with only incurring little computational overhead. To further improve the robustness and stability of joint optimization, we also propose techniques of smoothed 2D supervision, randomly scaled kernel parameters, and edge-guided loss mask. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis as well as rapid convergence for optimization. et.al.|[2402.13252](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13252)|**[link](https://github.com/nemo1999/joint-tensorf)**|
|**2024-02-20**|**NeRF Solves Undersampled MRI Reconstruction**|This article presents a novel undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that leverages the concept of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). With radial undersampling, the corresponding imaging problem can be reformulated into an image modeling task from sparse-view rendered data; therefore, a high dimensional MR image is obtainable from undersampled $k$-space data by taking advantage of implicit neural representation. A multi-layer perceptron, which is designed to output an image intensity from a spatial coordinate, learns the MR physics-driven rendering relation between given measurement data and desired image. Effective undersampling strategies for high-quality neural representation are investigated. The proposed method serves two benefits: (i) The learning is based fully on single undersampled $k$-space data, not a bunch of measured data and target image sets. It can be used potentially for diagnostic MR imaging, such as fetal MRI, where data acquisition is relatively rare or limited against diversity of clinical images while undersampled reconstruction is highly demanded. (ii) A reconstructed MR image is a scan-specific representation highly adaptive to the given $k$ -space measurement. Numerous experiments validate the feasibility and capability of the proposed approach. et.al.|[2402.13226](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226)|null|
|**2024-02-20**|**OccFlowNet: Towards Self-supervised Occupancy Estimation via Differentiable Rendering and Occupancy Flow**|Semantic occupancy has recently gained significant traction as a prominent 3D scene representation. However, most existing methods rely on large and costly datasets with fine-grained 3D voxel labels for training, which limits their practicality and scalability, increasing the need for self-monitored learning in this domain. In this work, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation inspired by neural radiance field (NeRF) using only 2D labels, which are considerably easier to acquire. In particular, we employ differentiable volumetric rendering to predict depth and semantic maps and train a 3D network based on 2D supervision only. To enhance geometric accuracy and increase the supervisory signal, we introduce temporal rendering of adjacent time steps. Additionally, we introduce occupancy flow as a mechanism to handle dynamic objects in the scene and ensure their temporal consistency. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate that 2D supervision only is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to methods using 3D labels, while outperforming concurrent 2D approaches. When combining 2D supervision with 3D labels, temporal rendering and occupancy flow we outperform all previous occupancy estimation models significantly. We conclude that the proposed rendering supervision and occupancy flow advances occupancy estimation and further bridges the gap towards self-supervised learning in this domain. et.al.|[2402.12792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12792)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**Binary Opacity Grids: Capturing Fine Geometric Detail for Mesh-Based View Synthesis**|While surface-based view synthesis algorithms are appealing due to their low computational requirements, they often struggle to reproduce thin structures. In contrast, more expensive methods that model the scene's geometry as a volumetric density field (e.g. NeRF) excel at reconstructing fine geometric detail. However, density fields often represent geometry in a "fuzzy" manner, which hinders exact localization of the surface. In this work, we modify density fields to encourage them to converge towards surfaces, without compromising their ability to reconstruct thin structures. First, we employ a discrete opacity grid representation instead of a continuous density field, which allows opacity values to discontinuously transition from zero to one at the surface. Second, we anti-alias by casting multiple rays per pixel, which allows occlusion boundaries and subpixel structures to be modelled without using semi-transparent voxels. Third, we minimize the binary entropy of the opacity values, which facilitates the extraction of surface geometry by encouraging opacity values to binarize towards the end of training. Lastly, we develop a fusion-based meshing strategy followed by mesh simplification and appearance model fitting. The compact meshes produced by our model can be rendered in real-time on mobile devices and achieve significantly higher view synthesis quality compared to existing mesh-based approaches. et.al.|[2402.12377](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12377)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**Colorizing Monochromatic Radiance Fields**|Though Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can produce colorful 3D representations of the world by using a set of 2D images, such ability becomes non-existent when only monochromatic images are provided. Since color is necessary in representing the world, reproducing color from monochromatic radiance fields becomes crucial. To achieve this goal, instead of manipulating the monochromatic radiance fields directly, we consider it as a representation-prediction task in the Lab color space. By first constructing the luminance and density representation using monochromatic images, our prediction stage can recreate color representation on the basis of an image colorization module. We then reproduce a colorful implicit model through the representation of luminance, density, and color. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.

It explores how NeRFs adeptly infer 3D representations for both stationary and dynamic objects in a scene. This capability is pivotal for generating high-quality new viewpoints, completing missing scene details (inpainting), conducting comprehensive scene segmentation (panoptic segmentation), predicting 3D bounding boxes, editing 3D scenes, and extracting object-centric 3D models. A significant aspect of this study is the application of semantic labels as viewpoint-invariant functions, which effectively map spatial coordinates to a spectrum of semantic labels, thus facilitating the recognition of distinct objects within the scene. Overall, this survey highlights the progression and diverse applications of semantically-aware neural radiance fields in the context of visual scene interpretation. et.al.|[2402.11141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11141)|**[link](https://github.com/abourki/sota-semantically-aware-nerfs)**|

Traditional techniques often struggle to capture the complex details of plants, which is crucial for botanical and agricultural understanding. We evaluate three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth data. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.65% F1 score with 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficiency and accuracy of NeRFs in challenging environments.

|**2024-02-14**|**PC-NeRF: Parent-Child Neural Radiance Fields Using Sparse LiDAR Frames in Autonomous Driving Environments**|Large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis are vital for autonomous vehicles, especially utilizing temporally sparse LiDAR frames. However, conventional explicit representations remain a significant bottleneck towards representing the reconstructed and synthetic scenes at unlimited resolution. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown compelling results in implicit representations, the problem of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis using sparse LiDAR frames remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis framework called parent-child neural radiance field (PC-NeRF). Based on its two modules, parent NeRF and child NeRF, the framework implements hierarchical spatial partitioning and multi-level scene representation, including scene, segment, and point levels. The multi-level scene representation enhances the efficient utilization of sparse LiDAR point cloud data and enables the rapid acquisition of an approximate volumetric scene representation. With extensive experiments, PC-NeRF is proven to achieve high-precision novel LiDAR view synthesis and 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Moreover, PC-NeRF can effectively handle situations with sparse LiDAR frames and demonstrate high deployment efficiency with limited training epochs.

While Adam is commonly used for training due to its stochastic proficiency, it entails lengthy training durations. To address this, we explore alternative optimization techniques for accelerated training without sacrificing accuracy. Traditional second-order optimizers like L-BFGS are suboptimal in stochastic settings, making them unsuitable for large-scale data sets. Instead, we propose stochastic training using curvature-aware diagonal preconditioners, showcasing their effectiveness across various signal modalities such as images, shape reconstruction, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). et.al.|[2402.08784](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08784)|null|

We here ask the question whether we can transfer the appearance from a source NeRF onto a target 3D geometry in a semantically meaningful way, such that the resulting new NeRF retains the target geometry but has an appearance that is an analogy to the source NeRF. To this end, we generalize classic image analogies from 2D images to NeRFs. We leverage correspondence transfer along semantic affinity that is driven by semantic features from large, pre-trained 2D image models to achieve multi-view consistent appearance transfer. Our method allows exploring the mix-and-match product space of 3D geometry and appearance. We show that our method outperforms traditional stylization-based methods and that a large majority of users prefer our method over several typical baselines. et.al.|[2402.08622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08622)|null|

This method achieves a nuanced balance, carefully preserving the geometric integrity of room layouts while also capturing intricate surface details of specific objects. A cornerstone of our two-phase learning framework is the introduction of the Object Surface Field (OSF), a novel concept designed to mitigate the persistent vanishing gradient problem that has previously hindered the capture of high-frequency details in other methods.

The proposed representation model combines a PointNet encoder and a conditional neural radiance field (NeRF), facilitating a thorough acquisition of object deformations and variations in lighting conditions. To model the complex dynamics, we employ a recurrent state-space model (RSSM) that accurately predicts the transformation of the latent representation over time. Extensive simulation experiments with diverse objectives demonstrate the generalization capabilities of DeformNet for various deformable object manipulation tasks, even in the presence of previously unseen goals. Finally, we deploy DeformNet on an actual UR5 robotic arm to demonstrate its capability in real-world scenarios. et.al.|[2402.07648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07648)|null|

|**2024-02-09**|**ImplicitDeepfake: Plausible Face-Swapping through Implicit Deepfake Generation using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting**|Numerous emerging deep-learning techniques have had a substantial impact on computer graphics. Among the most promising breakthroughs are the recent rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). NeRFs encode the object's shape and color in neural network weights using a handful of images with known camera positions to generate novel views. In contrast, GS provides accelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by encoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian distributions. These two techniques have found many use cases in spatial computing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake methods has sparked considerable controversy. Such techniques can have a form of artificial intelligence-generated videos that closely mimic authentic footage. Using generative models, they can modify facial features, enabling the creation of altered identities or facial expressions that exhibit a remarkably realistic appearance to a real person. Despite these controversies, deepfake can offer a next-generation solution for avatar creation and gaming when of desirable quality. To that end, we show how to combine all these emerging technologies to obtain a more plausible outcome. Our ImplicitDeepfake1 uses the classical deepfake algorithm to modify all training images separately and then train NeRF and GS on modified faces. Such relatively simple strategies can produce plausible 3D deepfake-based avatars. et.al.|[2402.06390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06390)|**[link](https://github.com/quereste/implicit-deepfake)**|

Here lighting is an important part of achieving faithful light transport simulation. While the environment map is commonly used as the lighting model in inverse rendering, we show that its distant lighting assumption leads to spatial invariant lighting, which can be an inaccurate approximation in real-world inverse rendering. We propose to use NeRF as a spatially varying environment lighting model and build an inverse rendering pipeline using NeRF as the non-distant environment emitter. By comparing our method with the environment map on real and synthetic datasets, we show that our NeRF-based emitter models the scene lighting more accurately and leads to more accurate inverse rendering.

|**2024-02-07**|**OV-NeRF: Open-vocabulary Neural Radiance Fields with Vision and Language Foundation Models for 3D Semantic Understanding**|The development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has provided a potent representation for encapsulating the geometric and appearance characteristics of 3D scenes. Enhancing the capabilities of NeRFs in open-vocabulary 3D semantic perception tasks has been a recent focus. However, current methods that extract semantics directly from Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for semantic field learning encounter difficulties due to noisy and view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and language foundation models to enhance semantic field learning through proposed single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective, we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask proposals derived from SAM to rectify the noisy semantics of each training view, facilitating accurate semantic field learning. Second, from the cross-view perspective, we propose a Cross-view Self-enhancement (CSE) strategy to address the challenge raised by view-inconsistent semantics. Rather than invariably utilizing the 2D inconsistent semantics from CLIP, CSE leverages the 3D consistent semantics generated from the well-trained semantic field itself for semantic field training, aiming to reduce ambiguity and enhance overall semantic consistency across different views. Extensive experiments validate our OV-NeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement of 20.31% and 18.42% in mIoU metric on Replica and Scannet, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits consistent superior results across various CLIP configurations, further verifying its robustness. et.al.|[2402.04648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04648)|null|
|**2024-02-11**|**BirdNeRF: Fast Neural Reconstruction of Large-Scale Scenes From Aerial Imagery**|In this study, we introduce BirdNeRF, an adaptation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) designed specifically for reconstructing large-scale scenes using aerial imagery. Unlike previous research focused on small-scale and object-centric NeRF reconstruction, our approach addresses multiple challenges, including (1) Addressing the issue of slow training and rendering associated with large models. (2) Meeting the computational demands necessitated by modeling a substantial number of images, requiring extensive resources such as high-performance GPUs. (3) Overcoming significant artifacts and low visual fidelity commonly observed in large-scale reconstruction tasks due to limited model capacity. Specifically, we present a novel bird-view pose-based spatial decomposition algorithm that decomposes a large aerial image set into multiple small sets with appropriately sized overlaps, allowing us to train individual NeRFs of sub-scene. This decomposition approach not only decouples rendering time from the scene size but also enables rendering to scale seamlessly to arbitrarily large environments. Moreover, it allows for per-block updates of the environment, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the reconstruction process. Additionally, we propose a projection-guided novel view re-rendering strategy, which aids in effectively utilizing the independently trained sub-scenes to generate superior rendering results. We evaluate our approach on existing datasets as well as against our own drone footage, improving reconstruction speed by 10x over classical photogrammetry software and 50x over state-of-the-art large-scale NeRF solution, on a single GPU with similar rendering quality. et.al.|[2402.04554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04554)|null|

Unfortunately, weight space models tend to suffer from substantial overfitting. We empirically analyze the reasons for this overfitting and find that a key reason is the lack of diversity in DWS datasets. While a given object can be represented by many different weight configurations, typical INR training sets fail to capture variability across INRs that represent the same object. To address this, we explore strategies for data augmentation in weight spaces and propose a MixUp method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in two setups. In classification, they improve performance similarly to having up to 10 times more data. In self-supervised contrastive learning, they yield substantial 5-10% gains in downstream classification. et.al.|[2402.04081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04081)|null|

Each approach offers specific strengths but also comes with specific limitations in their applicability. This work introduces ViewFusion, a state-of-the-art end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target scene only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely undetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than state-of-the-art methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small dataset NMR.

This work aims to achieve zero-shot controlled stylization in 3D scenes utilizing text or visual input as conditioning factors. We introduce ConRF, a novel method of zero-shot stylization. Specifically, due to the ambiguity of CLIP features, we employ a conversion process that maps the CLIP feature space to the style space of a pre-trained VGG network and then refine the CLIP multi-modal knowledge into a style transfer neural radiation field. Additionally, we use a 3D volumetric representation to perform local style transfer. By combining these operations, ConRF offers the capability to utilize either text or images as references, resulting in the generation of sequences with novel views enhanced by global or local stylization. Our experiment demonstrates that ConRF outperforms other existing methods for 3D scene and single-text stylization in terms of visual quality. et.al.|[2402.01950](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01950)|**[link](https://github.com/xingy038/conrf)**|
|**2024-02-02**|**Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference**|How do we infer a 3D scene from a single image in the presence of corruptions like rain, snow or fog? Straightforward domain randomization relies on knowing the family of corruptions ahead of time. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach-dubbed robust inverse graphics (RIG)-that relies on a strong scene prior and an uninformative uniform corruption prior, making it applicable to a wide range of corruptions. Given a single image, RIG performs posterior inference jointly over the scene and the corruption. We demonstrate this idea by training a neural radiance field (NeRF) scene prior and using a secondary NeRF to represent the corruptions over which we place an uninformative prior. RIG, trained only on clean data, outperforms depth estimators and alternative NeRF approaches that perform point estimation instead of full inference. The results hold for a number of scene prior architectures based on normalizing flows and diffusion models. For the latter, we develop reconstruction-guidance with auxiliary latents (ReGAL)-a diffusion conditioning algorithm that is applicable in the presence of auxiliary latent variables such as the corruption. RIG demonstrates how scene priors can be used beyond generation tasks. et.al.|[2402.01915](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01915)|null|

To address this issue, we propose a few-shot learning approach based on the hypernetwork paradigm that does not require gradient optimization during inference. The hypernetwork gathers information from the training data and generates an update for universal weights. As a result, we have developed an efficient method for generating a high-quality 3D object representation from a small number of images in a single step.

This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with unknown relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

|**2024-02-06**|**GaMeS: Mesh-Based Adapting and Modification of Gaussian Splatting**|In recent years, a range of neural network-based methods for image rendering have been introduced. For instance, widely-researched neural radiance fields (NeRF) rely on a neural network to represent 3D scenes, allowing for realistic view synthesis from a small number of 2D images. However, most NeRF models are constrained by long training and inference times. In comparison, Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a novel, state-of-theart technique for rendering points in a 3D scene by approximating their contribution to image pixels through Gaussian distributions, warranting fast training and swift, real-time rendering. A drawback of GS is the absence of a well-defined approach for its conditioning due to the necessity to condition several hundred thousand Gaussian components. To solve this, we introduce Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) model, a hybrid of mesh and a Gaussian distribution, that pin all Gaussians splats on the object surface (mesh). The unique contribution of our methods is defining Gaussian splats solely based on their location on the mesh, allowing for automatic adjustments in position, scale, and rotation during animation. As a result, we obtain high-quality renders in the real-time generation of high-quality views. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the absence of a predefined mesh, it is possible to fine-tune the initial mesh during the learning process. et.al.|[2402.01459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01459)|**[link](https://github.com/waczjoan/gaussian-mesh-splatting)**|
|**2024-02-02**|**Efficient Dynamic-NeRF Based Volumetric Video Coding with Rate Distortion Optimization**|Volumetric videos, benefiting from immersive 3D realism and interactivity, hold vast potential for various applications, while the tremendous data volume poses significant challenges for compression. Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on various datasets. et.al.|[2402.01380](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01380)|null|
|**2024-02-06**|**Taming Uncertainty in Sparse-view Generalizable NeRF via Indirect Diffusion Guidance**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated effectiveness in synthesizing novel views. However, their reliance on dense inputs and scene-specific optimization has limited their broader applicability. Generalizable NeRFs (Gen-NeRF), while intended to address this, often produce blurring artifacts in unobserved regions with sparse inputs, which are full of uncertainty. In this paper, we aim to diminish the uncertainty in Gen-NeRF for plausible renderings. We assume that NeRF's inability to effectively mitigate this uncertainty stems from its inherent lack of generative capacity. Therefore, we innovatively propose an Indirect Diffusion-guided NeRF framework, termed ID-NeRF, to address this uncertainty from a generative perspective by leveraging a distilled diffusion prior as guidance. Specifically, to avoid model confusion caused by directly regularizing with inconsistent samplings as in previous methods, our approach introduces a strategy to indirectly inject the inherently missing imagination into the learned implicit function through a diffusion-guided latent space. Empirical evaluation across various benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of our approach in handling uncertainty with sparse inputs. et.al.|[2402.01217](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01217)|null|
|**2024-02-01**|**ViCA-NeRF: View-Consistency-Aware 3D Editing of Neural Radiance Fields**|We introduce ViCA-NeRF, the first view-consistency-aware method for 3D editing with text instructions. In addition to the implicit neural radiance field (NeRF) modeling, our key insight is to exploit two sources of regularization that explicitly propagate the editing information across different views, thus ensuring multi-view consistency. For geometric regularization, we leverage the depth information derived from NeRF to establish image correspondences between different views. For learned regularization, we align the latent codes in the 2D diffusion model between edited and unedited images, enabling us to edit key views and propagate the update throughout the entire scene. Incorporating these two strategies, our ViCA-NeRF operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we blend edits from different views to create a preliminary 3D edit. This is followed by a second stage of NeRF training, dedicated to further refining the scene's appearance. Experimental results demonstrate that ViCA-NeRF provides more flexible, efficient (3 times faster) editing with higher levels of consistency and details, compared with the state of the art. Our code is publicly available. et.al.|[2402.00864](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00864)|**[link](https://github.com/dongjiahua/vica-nerf)**|
|**2024-02-01**|**Emo-Avatar: Efficient Monocular Video Style Avatar through Texture Rendering**|Artistic video portrait generation is a significant and sought-after task in the fields of computer graphics and vision. While various methods have been developed that integrate NeRFs or StyleGANs with instructional editing models for creating and editing drivable portraits, these approaches face several challenges. They often rely heavily on large datasets, require extensive customization processes, and frequently result in reduced image quality. To address the above problems, we propose the Efficient Monotonic Video Style Avatar (Emo-Avatar) through deferred neural rendering that enhances StyleGAN's capacity for producing dynamic, drivable portrait videos. We proposed a two-stage deferred neural rendering pipeline. In the first stage, we utilize few-shot PTI initialization to initialize the StyleGAN generator through several extreme poses sampled from the video to capture the consistent representation of aligned faces from the target portrait. In the second stage, we propose a Laplacian pyramid for high-frequency texture sampling from UV maps deformed by dynamic flow of expression for motion-aware texture prior integration to provide torso features to enhance StyleGAN's ability to generate complete and upper body for portrait video rendering. Emo-Avatar reduces style customization time from hours to merely 5 minutes compared with existing methods. In addition, Emo-Avatar requires only a single reference image for editing and employs region-aware contrastive learning with semantic invariant CLIP guidance, ensuring consistent high-resolution output and identity preservation. Through both quantitative and qualitative assessments, Emo-Avatar demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in terms of training efficiency, rendering quality and editability in self- and cross-reenactment. et.al.|[2402.00827](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00827)|null|
|**2024-01-31**|**CARFF: Conditional Auto-encoded Radiance Field for 3D Scene Forecasting**|We propose CARFF: Conditional Auto-encoded Radiance Field for 3D Scene Forecasting, a method for predicting future 3D scenes given past observations, such as 2D ego-centric images. Our method maps an image to a distribution over plausible 3D latent scene configurations using a probabilistic encoder, and predicts the evolution of the hypothesized scenes through time. Our latent scene representation conditions a global Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to represent a 3D scene model, which enables explainable predictions and straightforward downstream applications. This approach extends beyond previous neural rendering work by considering complex scenarios of uncertainty in environmental states and dynamics. We employ a two-stage training of Pose-Conditional-VAE and NeRF to learn 3D representations. Additionally, we auto-regressively predict latent scene representations as a partially observable Markov decision process, utilizing a mixture density network. We demonstrate the utility of our method in realistic scenarios using the CARLA driving simulator, where CARFF can be used to enable efficient trajectory and contingency planning in complex multi-agent autonomous driving scenarios involving visual occlusions. et.al.|[2401.18075](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18075)|null|
|**2024-02-01**|**Segment Anything in 3D Gaussians**|3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an alternative 3D representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), benefiting from its high-quality rendering results and real-time rendering speed. Considering the 3D Gaussian representation remains unparsed, it is necessary first to execute object segmentation within this domain. Subsequently, scene editing and collision detection can be performed, proving vital to a multitude of applications, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), game/movie production, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieve object segmentation in 3D Gaussian via an interactive procedure without any training process and learned parameters. We refer to the proposed method as SA-GS, for Segment Anything in 3D Gaussians. Given a set of clicked points in a single input view, SA-GS can generalize SAM to achieve 3D consistent segmentation via the proposed multi-view mask generation and view-wise label assignment methods. We also propose a cross-view label-voting approach to assign labels from different views. In addition, in order to address the boundary roughness issue of segmented objects resulting from the non-negligible spatial sizes of 3D Gaussian located at the boundary, SA-GS incorporates the simple but effective Gaussian Decomposition scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-GS achieves high-quality 3D segmentation results, which can also be easily applied for scene editing and collision detection tasks. Codes will be released soon. et.al.|[2401.17857](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17857)|null|
|**2024-01-30**|**Physical Priors Augmented Event-Based 3D Reconstruction**|3D neural implicit representations play a significant component in many robotic applications. However, reconstructing neural radiance fields (NeRF) from realistic event data remains a challenge due to the sparsities and the lack of information when only event streams are available. In this paper, we utilize motion, geometry, and density priors behind event data to impose strong physical constraints to augment NeRF training. The proposed novel pipeline can directly benefit from those priors to reconstruct 3D scenes without additional inputs. Moreover, we present a novel density-guided patch-based sampling strategy for robust and efficient learning, which not only accelerates training procedures but also conduces to expressions of local geometries. More importantly, we establish the first large dataset for event-based 3D reconstruction, which contains 101 objects with various materials and geometries, along with the groundtruth of images and depth maps for all camera viewpoints, which significantly facilitates other research in the related fields. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Mercerai/PAEv3d. et.al.|[2401.17121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17121)|**[link](https://github.com/mercerai/paev3d)**|
|**2024-01-31**|**Endo-4DGS: Endoscopic Monocular Scene Reconstruction with 4D Gaussian Splatting**|In the realm of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, dynamic scene reconstruction can significantly enhance downstream tasks and improve surgical outcomes. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods have recently risen to prominence for their exceptional ability to reconstruct scenes. Nonetheless, these methods are hampered by slow inference, prolonged training, and substantial computational demands. Additionally, some rely on stereo depth estimation, which is often infeasible due to the high costs and logistical challenges associated with stereo cameras. Moreover, the monocular reconstruction quality for deformable scenes is currently inadequate. To overcome these obstacles, we present Endo-4DGS, an innovative, real-time endoscopic dynamic reconstruction approach that utilizes 4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and requires no ground truth depth data. This method extends 3D GS by incorporating a temporal component and leverages a lightweight MLP to capture temporal Gaussian deformations. This effectively facilitates the reconstruction of dynamic surgical scenes with variable conditions. We also integrate Depth-Anything to generate pseudo-depth maps from monocular views, enhancing the depth-guided reconstruction process. Our approach has been validated on two surgical datasets, where it can effectively render in real-time, compute efficiently, and reconstruct with remarkable accuracy. These results underline the vast potential of Endo-4DGS to improve surgical assistance. et.al.|[2401.16416](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16416)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**Divide and Conquer: Rethinking the Training Paradigm of Neural Radiance Fields**|Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have exhibited potential in synthesizing high-fidelity views of 3D scenes but the standard training paradigm of NeRF presupposes an equal importance for each image in the training set. This assumption poses a significant challenge for rendering specific views presenting intricate geometries, thereby resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we take a closer look at the implications of the current training paradigm and redesign this for more superior rendering quality by NeRFs. Dividing input views into multiple groups based on their visual similarities and training individual models on each of these groups enables each model to specialize on specific regions without sacrificing speed or efficiency. Subsequently, the knowledge of these specialized models is aggregated into a single entity via a teacher-student distillation paradigm, enabling spatial efficiency for online render-ing. Empirically, we evaluate our novel training framework on two publicly available datasets, namely NeRF synthetic and Tanks&Temples. Our evaluation demonstrates that our DaC training pipeline enhances the rendering quality of a state-of-the-art baseline model while exhibiting convergence to a superior minimum. et.al.|[2401.16144](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16144)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**3D Reconstruction and New View Synthesis of Indoor Environments based on a Dual Neural Radiance Field**|Simultaneously achieving 3D reconstruction and new view synthesis for indoor environments has widespread applications but is technically very challenging. State-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural functions can achieve excellent 3D reconstruction results, but their performances on new view synthesis can be unsatisfactory. The exciting development of neural radiance field (NeRF) has revolutionized new view synthesis, however, NeRF-based models can fail to reconstruct clean geometric surfaces. We have developed a dual neural radiance field (Du-NeRF) to simultaneously achieve high-quality geometry reconstruction and view rendering. Du-NeRF contains two geometric fields, one derived from the SDF field to facilitate geometric reconstruction and the other derived from the density field to boost new view synthesis. One of the innovative features of Du-NeRF is that it decouples a view-independent component from the density field and uses it as a label to supervise the learning process of the SDF field. This reduces shape-radiance ambiguity and enables geometry and color to benefit from each other during the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Du-NeRF can significantly improve the performance of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction for indoor environments and it is particularly effective in constructing areas containing fine geometries that do not obey multi-view color consistency. et.al.|[2401.14726](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14726)|null|
|**2024-01-25**|**Learning Robust Generalizable Radiance Field with Visibility and Feature Augmented Point Representation**|This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF). Previous generic NeRF methods combine multiview stereo techniques with image-based neural rendering for generalization, yielding impressive results, while suffering from three issues. First, occlusions often result in inconsistent feature matching. Then, they deliver distortions and artifacts in geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation. Third, their image-based representations experience severe degradations when source views are not near enough to the target view. To address challenges, we propose the first paradigm that constructs the generalizable neural field based on point-based rather than image-based rendering, which we call the Generalizable neural Point Field (GPF). Our approach explicitly models visibilities by geometric priors and augments them with neural features. We propose a novel nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve both rendering speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we present a learnable kernel spatially augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries. Besides, our representation can be easily manipulated. Experiments show that our model can deliver better geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings, preliminarily proving the potential of the new paradigm for generalizable NeRF. et.al.|[2401.14354](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14354)|null|
|**2024-01-27**|**Sketch2NeRF: Multi-view Sketch-guided Text-to-3D Generation**|Recently, text-to-3D approaches have achieved high-fidelity 3D content generation using text description. However, the generated objects are stochastic and lack fine-grained control. Sketches provide a cheap approach to introduce such fine-grained control. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve flexible control from these sketches due to their abstraction and ambiguity. In this paper, we present a multi-view sketch-guided text-to-3D generation framework (namely, Sketch2NeRF) to add sketch control to 3D generation. Specifically, our method leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) to supervise the optimization of a 3D scene represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). We propose a novel synchronized generation and reconstruction method to effectively optimize the NeRF. In the experiments, we collected two kinds of multi-view sketch datasets to evaluate the proposed method. We demonstrate that our method can synthesize 3D consistent contents with fine-grained sketch control while being high-fidelity to text prompts. Extensive results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of sketch similarity and text alignment. et.al.|[2401.14257](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14257)|null|

|**2024-01-23**|**NeRF-AD: Neural Radiance Field with Attention-based Disentanglement for Talking Face Synthesis**|Talking face synthesis driven by audio is one of the current research hotspots in the fields of multidimensional signal processing and multimedia. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently been brought to this research field in order to enhance the realism and 3D effect of the generated faces. However, most existing NeRF-based methods either burden NeRF with complex learning tasks while lacking methods for supervised multimodal feature fusion, or cannot precisely map audio to the facial region related to speech movements. These reasons ultimately result in existing methods generating inaccurate lip shapes. This paper moves a portion of NeRF learning tasks ahead and proposes a talking face synthesis method via NeRF with attention-based disentanglement (NeRF-AD). In particular, an Attention-based Disentanglement module is introduced to disentangle the face into Audio-face and Identity-face using speech-related facial action unit (AU) information. To precisely regulate how audio affects the talking face, we only fuse the Audio-face with audio feature. In addition, AU information is also utilized to supervise the fusion of these two modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our NeRF-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating realistic talking face videos, including image quality and lip synchronization.

However, the high computational cost limits intuitive and efficient editing of scenes, making NeRF's development in the scene editing field facing many challenges. This paper reviews the preliminary explorations of scholars on NeRF in the scene or object editing field in recent years, mainly changing the shape and texture of scenes or objects in new synthesized scenes; through the combination of residual models such as GaN and Transformer with NeRF, the generalization ability of NeRF scene editing has been further expanded, including realizing real-time new perspective editing feedback, multimodal editing of text synthesized 3D scenes, 4D synthesis performance, and in-depth exploration in light and shadow editing, initially achieving optimization of indirect touch editing and detail representation in complex scenes. Currently, most NeRF editing methods focus on the touch points and materials of indirect points, but when dealing with more complex or larger 3D scenes, it is difficult to balance accuracy, breadth, efficiency, and quality. Overcoming these challenges may become the direction of future NeRF 3D scene editing technology. et.al.|[2401.12456](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12456)|null|

To better capture complex real dynamics such as contact and friction, learned simulators based on graph networks have recently shown great promise. However, applying these learned simulators to real scenes comes with two major challenges: first, scaling learned simulators to handle the complexity of real world scenes which can involve hundreds of objects each with complicated 3D shapes, and second, handling inputs from perception rather than 3D state information. Here we introduce a method which substantially reduces the memory required to run graph-based learned simulators. Based on this memory-efficient simulation model, we then present a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can be processed by graph network simulator. We show that our method uses substantially less memory than previous graph-based simulators while retaining their accuracy, and that the simulators learned in synthetic environments can be applied to real world scenes captured from multiple camera angles. This paves the way for expanding the application of learned simulators to settings where only perceptual information is available at inference time. et.al.|[2401.11985](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11985)|null|

Nevertheless, NeRF exhibit pronounced performance degradation when confronted with sparse view inputs, consequently curtailing its further applicability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Geometric, Semantic, and Photometric Guided NeRF (HG3-NeRF), a novel methodology that can address the aforementioned limitation and enhance consistency of geometry, semantic content, and appearance across different views. We propose Hierarchical Geometric Guidance (HGG) to incorporate the attachment of Structure from Motion (SfM), namely sparse depth prior, into the scene representations. Different from direct depth supervision, HGG samples volume points from local-to-global geometric regions, mitigating the misalignment caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine scene representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HG3-NeRF can outperform other state-of-the-art methods on different standard benchmarks and achieve high-fidelity synthesis results for sparse view inputs. et.al.|[2401.11711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11711)|null|

Since then, technopreneurs have sought to leverage NeRF models into a profitable business. Therefore, NeRF models make it worth the risk of plagiarizers illegally copying, re-distributing, or misusing those models. This paper proposes a comprehensive intellectual property (IP) protection framework for the NeRF model in both black-box and white-box settings, namely IPR-NeRF. In the black-box setting, a diffusion-based solution is introduced to embed and extract the watermark via a two-stage optimization process. In the white-box setting, a designated digital signature is embedded into the weights of the NeRF model by adopting the sign loss objective. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that not only does our approach maintain the fidelity (\ie, the rendering quality) of IPR-NeRF models, but it is also robust against both ambiguity and removal attacks compared to prior arts. et.al.|[2401.09495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09495)|null|

However, NeRF training requires accurate camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Recent works have attempted to relax this constraint, but they still often rely on decent initial poses which they can refine. Here we aim at removing the requirement for pose initialization. We present Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames. ICON only assumes smooth camera motion to estimate initial guess for poses. Further, ICON introduces ``confidence": an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF, and high-confidence 3D structure (as encoded by NeRF) to learn poses. We show that ICON, without prior pose initialization, achieves superior performance in both CO3D and HO3D versus methods which use SfM pose. et.al.|[2401.08937](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08937)|null|

However, they face challenges in the sparse view setting, lacking sufficient constraints from volume rendering. Reconstructing and understanding a 3D scene from sparse and unconstrained cameras is a long-standing problem in classical computer vision with diverse applications. While recent works have explored NeRFs in sparse, unconstrained view scenarios, their focus has been primarily on enhancing reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our approach takes a broader perspective by posing the question: "from where has each point been seen?" -- which gates how well we can understand and reconstruct it. In other words, we aim to determine the origin or provenance of each 3D point and its associated information under sparse, unconstrained views. We introduce ProvNeRF, a model that enriches a traditional NeRF representation by incorporating per-point provenance, modeling likely source locations for each point. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) for stochastic processes. Notably, our method is compatible with any pre-trained NeRF model and the associated training camera poses. We demonstrate that modeling per-point provenance offers several advantages, including uncertainty estimation, criteria-based view selection, and improved novel view synthesis, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Key to our approach is the utilization of learned implicit representations of visual and geometric features derived from a pre-trained NeRF. Though trained exclusively in a simulated environment with simplified objects and 4-DoF top-down grasps, our evaluation model and optimization procedure demonstrate generalization to 6-DoF grasps and novel objects both in simulation and in real-world settings, without the need for additional data.

|**2024-01-11**|**TriNeRFLet: A Wavelet Based Multiscale Triplane NeRF Representation**|In recent years, the neural radiance field (NeRF) model has gained popularity due to its ability to recover complex 3D scenes. Following its success, many approaches proposed different NeRF representations in order to further improve both runtime and performance. One such example is Triplane, in which NeRF is represented using three 2D feature planes. This enables easily using existing 2D neural networks in this framework, e.g., to generate the three planes. Despite its advantage, the triplane representation lagged behind in its 3D recovery quality compared to NeRF solutions. In this work, we propose TriNeRFLet, a 2D wavelet-based multiscale triplane representation for NeRF, which closes the 3D recovery performance gap and is competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Building upon the triplane framework, we also propose a novel super-resolution (SR) technique that combines a diffusion model with TriNeRFLet for improving NeRF resolution. et.al.|[2401.06191](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06191)|null|
|**2024-01-11**|**Fast High Dynamic Range Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes**|Neural Radiances Fields (NeRF) and their extensions have shown great success in representing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel-view images. However, most NeRF methods take in low-dynamic-range (LDR) images, which may lose details, especially with nonuniform illumination. Some previous NeRF methods attempt to introduce high-dynamic-range (HDR) techniques but mainly target static scenes. To extend HDR NeRF methods to wider applications, we propose a dynamic HDR NeRF framework, named HDR-HexPlane, which can learn 3D scenes from dynamic 2D images captured with various exposures. A learnable exposure mapping function is constructed to obtain adaptive exposure values for each image. Based on the monotonically increasing prior, a camera response function is designed for stable learning. With the proposed model, high-quality novel-view images at any time point can be rendered with any desired exposure. We further construct a dataset containing multiple dynamic scenes captured with diverse exposures for evaluation.

|**2024-01-11**|**CoSSegGaussians: Compact and Swift Scene Segmenting 3D Gaussians**|We propose Compact and Swift Segmenting 3D Gaussians(CoSSegGaussians), a method for compact 3D-consistent scene segmentation at fast rendering speed with only RGB images input. Previous NeRF-based 3D segmentation methods have relied on implicit or voxel neural scene representation and ray-marching volume rendering which are time consuming. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting significantly improves the rendering speed, however, existing Gaussians-based segmentation methods(eg: Gaussian Grouping) fail to provide compact segmentation masks especially in zero-shot segmentation, which is mainly caused by the lack of robustness and compactness for straightforwardly assigning learnable parameters to each Gaussian when encountering inconsistent 2D machine-generated labels. Our method aims to achieve compact and reliable zero-shot scene segmentation swiftly by mapping fused spatial and semantically meaningful features for each Gaussian point with a shallow decoding network. Specifically, our method firstly optimizes Gaussian points' position, convariance and color attributes under the supervision of RGB images. After Gaussian Locating, we distill multi-scale DINO features extracted from images through unprojection to each Gaussian, which is then incorporated with spatial features from the fast point features processing network, i.e. RandLA-Net. Then the shallow decoding MLP is applied to the multi-scale fused features to obtain compact segmentation. Experimental results show that our model can perform high-quality zero-shot scene segmentation, as our model outperforms other segmentation methods on both semantic and panoptic segmentation task, meanwhile consumes approximately only 10% segmenting time compared to NeRF-based segmentation. Code and more results will be available at https://David-Dou.github.io/CoSSegGaussians et.al.|[2401.05925](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05925)|null|
|**2024-01-11**|**GO-NeRF: Generating Virtual Objects in Neural Radiance Fields**|Despite advances in 3D generation, the direct creation of 3D objects within an existing 3D scene represented as NeRF remains underexplored. This process requires not only high-quality 3D object generation but also seamless composition of the generated 3D content into the existing NeRF. To this end, we propose a new method, GO-NeRF, capable of utilizing scene context for high-quality and harmonious 3D object generation within an existing NeRF. Our method employs a compositional rendering formulation that allows the generated 3D objects to be seamlessly composited into the scene utilizing learned 3D-aware opacity maps without introducing unintended scene modification. Moreover, we also develop tailored optimization objectives and training strategies to enhance the model's ability to exploit scene context and mitigate artifacts, such as floaters, originating from 3D object generation within a scene. Extensive experiments on both feed-forward and $360^o$ scenes show the superior performance of our proposed GO-NeRF in generating objects harmoniously composited with surrounding scenes and synthesizing high-quality novel view images.

|**2024-01-10**|**Diffusion Priors for Dynamic View Synthesis from Monocular Videos**|Dynamic novel view synthesis aims to capture the temporal evolution of visual content within videos. Existing methods struggle to distinguishing between motion and structure, particularly in scenarios where camera poses are either unknown or constrained compared to object motion. Furthermore, with information solely from reference images, it is extremely challenging to hallucinate unseen regions that are occluded or partially observed in the given videos. To address these issues, we first finetune a pretrained RGB-D diffusion model on the video frames using a customization technique. Subsequently, we distill the knowledge from the finetuned model to a 4D representations encompassing both dynamic and static Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) components. The proposed pipeline achieves geometric consistency while preserving the scene identity. We perform thorough experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results demonstrate the robustness and utility of our approach in challenging cases, further advancing dynamic novel view synthesis. et.al.|[2401.05583](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05583)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**InseRF: Text-Driven Generative Object Insertion in Neural 3D Scenes**|We introduce InseRF, a novel method for generative object insertion in the NeRF reconstructions of 3D scenes. Based on a user-provided textual description and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in 3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly transformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion models in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in editing 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing objects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods, which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D object insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The 2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method. The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors of monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D scenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our experiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate the effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods. InseRF is capable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiring explicit 3D information as input.

|**2024-01-10**|**CTNeRF: Cross-Time Transformer for Dynamic Neural Radiance Field from Monocular Video**|The goal of our work is to generate high-quality novel views from monocular videos of complex and dynamic scenes. Prior methods, such as DynamicNeRF, have shown impressive performance by leveraging time-varying dynamic radiation fields. However, these methods have limitations when it comes to accurately modeling the motion of complex objects, which can lead to inaccurate and blurry renderings of details. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that builds upon a recent generalization NeRF, which aggregates nearby views onto new viewpoints. However, such methods are typically only effective for static scenes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a module that operates in both the time and frequency domains to aggregate the features of object motion. This allows us to learn the relationship between frames and generate higher-quality images. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene datasets. Specifically, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both the accuracy and visual quality of the synthesized views. et.al.|[2401.04861](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04861)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting**|3D Gaussian splatting (3D GS) has recently emerged as a transformative technique in the explicit radiance field and computer graphics landscape. This innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from the neural radiance field (NeRF) methodologies, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representations and differentiable rendering algorithms, not only promises real-time rendering capabilities but also introduces unprecedented levels of control and editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the advent of 3D GS, setting the stage for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By facilitating real-time performance, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research in this domain. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in applicable and explicit radiance field representation. et.al.|[2401.03890](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03890)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**NeRFmentation: NeRF-based Augmentation for Monocular Depth Estimation**|The capabilities of monocular depth estimation (MDE) models are limited by the availability of sufficient and diverse datasets. In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call "NeRFmentation", trains NeRFs on each scene in the dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving set, and our own synthetic test set. et.al.|[2401.03771](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03771)|null|
|**2024-01-06**|**RustNeRF: Robust Neural Radiance Field with Low-Quality Images**|Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) exploits multi-view 3D consistency, achieving impressive results in 3D scene modeling and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis. However, there are limitations. First, existing methods assume enough high-quality images are available for training the NeRF model, ignoring real-world image degradation. Second, previous methods struggle with ambiguity in the training set due to unmodeled inconsistencies among different views. In this work, we present RustNeRF for real-world high-quality NeRF. To improve NeRF's robustness under real-world inputs, we train a 3D-aware preprocessing network that incorporates real-world degradation modeling. We propose a novel implicit multi-view guidance to address information loss during image degradation and restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate RustNeRF's advantages over existing approaches under real-world degradation. The code will be released. et.al.|[2401.03257](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03257)|null|
|**2024-01-06**|**Hi-Map: Hierarchical Factorized Radiance Field for High-Fidelity Monocular Dense Mapping**|In this paper, we introduce Hi-Map, a novel monocular dense mapping approach based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Hi-Map is exceptional in its capacity to achieve efficient and high-fidelity mapping using only posed RGB inputs. Our method eliminates the need for external depth priors derived from e.g., a depth estimation model. Our key idea is to represent the scene as a hierarchical feature grid that encodes the radiance and then factorizes it into feature planes and vectors. As such, the scene representation becomes simpler and more generalizable for fast and smooth convergence on new observations. This allows for efficient computation while alleviating noise patterns by reducing the complexity of the scene representation. Buttressed by the hierarchical factorized representation, we leverage the Sign Distance Field (SDF) as a proxy of rendering for inferring the volume density, demonstrating high mapping fidelity. Moreover, we introduce a dual-path encoding strategy to strengthen the photometric cues and further boost the mapping quality, especially for the distant and textureless regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in geometric and textural accuracy over the state-of-the-art NeRF-based monocular mapping methods. et.al.|[2401.03203](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03203)|null|
|**2024-01-05**|**Progress and Prospects in 3D Generative AI: A Technical Overview including 3D human**|While AI-generated text and 2D images continue to expand its territory, 3D generation has gradually emerged as a trend that cannot be ignored. Since the year 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D generation. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but also the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key factors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion, coupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic human models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D models with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The advancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have accelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore, the multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language inputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly during the latter half year of 2023. It will begin by discussing the AI generated object models in 3D, followed by the generated 3D human models, and finally, the generated 3D human motions, culminating in a conclusive summary and a vision for the future. et.al.|[2401.02620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02620)|null|
|**2024-01-05**|**FED-NeRF: Achieve High 3D Consistency and Temporal Coherence for Face Video Editing on Dynamic NeRF**|The success of the GAN-NeRF structure has enabled face editing on NeRF to maintain 3D view consistency. However, achieving simultaneously multi-view consistency and temporal coherence while editing video sequences remains a formidable challenge. This paper proposes a novel face video editing architecture built upon the dynamic face GAN-NeRF structure, which effectively utilizes video sequences to restore the latent code and 3D face geometry. By editing the latent code, multi-view consistent editing on the face can be ensured, as validated by multiview stereo reconstruction on the resulting edited images in our dynamic NeRF. As the estimation of face geometries occurs on a frame-by-frame basis, this may introduce a jittering issue. We propose a stabilizer that maintains temporal coherence by preserving smooth changes of face expressions in consecutive frames. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our method, as the pioneering 4D face video editor, achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison to existing 2D or 3D-based approaches independently addressing identity and motion.

|**2024-01-05**|**Characterizing Satellite Geometry via Accelerated 3D Gaussian Splatting**|The accelerating deployment of spacecraft in orbit have generated interest in on-orbit servicing (OOS), inspection of spacecraft, and active debris removal (ADR). Such missions require precise rendezvous and proximity operations in the vicinity of non-cooperative, possible unknown, resident space objects. Safety concerns with manned missions and lag times with ground-based control necessitate complete autonomy. This requires robust characterization of the target's geometry. In this article, we present an approach for mapping geometries of satellites on orbit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that can run on computing resources available on current spaceflight hardware. We demonstrate model training and 3D rendering performance on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under several realistic lighting and motion conditions. Our model is shown to be capable of training on-board and rendering higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms.

|**2024-01-03**|**SIGNeRF: Scene Integrated Generation for Neural Radiance Fields**|Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh. et.al.|[2401.01647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01647)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**Street Gaussians for Modeling Dynamic Urban Scenes**|This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes from monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision in tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS (1066 $\times$ 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Furthermore, the proposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using precise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf tracker.

|**2024-01-02**|**Noise-NeRF: Hide Information in Neural Radiance Fields using Trainable Noise**|Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been proposed as an innovative 3D representation method. While attracting lots of attention, NeRF faces critical issues such as information confidentiality and security. Steganography is a technique used to embed information in another object as a means of protecting information security. Currently, there are few related studies on NeRF steganography, facing challenges in low steganography quality, model weight damage, and a limited amount of steganographic information. This paper proposes a novel NeRF steganography method based on trainable noise: Noise-NeRF. Furthermore, we propose the Adaptive Pixel Selection strategy and Pixel Perturbation strategy to improve the steganography quality and efficiency. The extensive experiments on open-source datasets show that Noise-NeRF provides state-of-the-art performances in both steganography quality and rendering quality, as well as effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography. et.al.|[2401.01216](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01216)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**3D Visibility-aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Interacting Hands**|Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes, objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover, current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically, given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas. Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image, the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms conventional NeRFs significantly.

|**2024-01-01**|**Sharp-NeRF: Grid-based Fast Deblurring Neural Radiance Fields Using Sharpness Prior**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in neural rendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual quality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect conditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations. Especially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally captured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render sharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key challenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a grid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry images within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based kernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The sharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur kernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry images and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics. The qualitative and quantitative results have revealed that our approach renders the sharp novel views with vivid colors and fine details, and it has considerably faster training time than the previous works.

|**2024-01-02**|**GD^2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields**|In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task which targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD $^2$-NeRF, a Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer (Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that GD$^2$ -NeRF noticeably improves the details while without per-scene finetuning. et.al.|[2401.00616](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00616)|null|
|**2023-12-30**|**Inpaint4DNeRF: Promptable Spatio-Temporal NeRF Inpainting with Generative Diffusion Models**|Current Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate photorealistic novel views. For editing 3D scenes represented by NeRF, with the advent of generative models, this paper proposes Inpaint4DNeRF to capitalize on state-of-the-art stable diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) for direct generation of the underlying completed background content, regardless of static or dynamic. The key advantages of this generative approach for NeRF inpainting are twofold. First, after rough mask propagation, to complete or fill in previously occluded content, we can individually generate a small subset of completed images with plausible content, called seed images, from which simple 3D geometry proxies can be derived. Second and the remaining problem is thus 3D multiview consistency among all completed images, now guided by the seed images and their 3D proxies. Without other bells and whistles, our generative Inpaint4DNeRF baseline framework is general which can be readily extended to 4D dynamic NeRFs, where temporal consistency can be naturally handled in a similar way as our multiview consistency. et.al.|[2401.00208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00208)|null|

Existing approaches solve this issue by reducing the number of input views and regularizing the learned volumetric representation with either complex losses or additional inputs from other modalities. In this paper, we present KeyNeRF, a simple yet effective method for training NeRF in few-shot scenarios by focusing on key informative rays. Such rays are first selected at camera level by a view selection algorithm that promotes baseline diversity while guaranteeing scene coverage, then at pixel level by sampling from a probability distribution based on local image entropy. Our approach performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal changes to existing NeRF codebases. et.al.|[2312.17561](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17561)|null|

Existing methods have successfully leveraged radiance field baking to facilitate real-time rendering of small scenes. However, when applied to large-scale scenes, these techniques encounter significant challenges, struggling to provide a seamless real-time experience due to limited resources in computation, memory, and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose City-on-Web, which represents the whole scene by partitioning it into manageable blocks, each with its own Level-of-Detail, ensuring high fidelity, efficient memory management and fast rendering. Meanwhile, we carefully design the training and inference process such that the final rendering result on web is consistent with training.

However, existing scene-level datasets for deep learning-based 3D vision, limited to either synthetic environments or a narrow selection of real-world scenes, are quite insufficient. This insufficiency not only hinders a comprehensive benchmark of existing methods but also caps what could be explored in deep learning-based 3D analysis. To address this critical gap, we present DL3DV-10K, a large-scale scene dataset, featuring 51.2 million frames from 10,510 videos captured from 65 types of point-of-interest (POI) locations, covering both bounded and unbounded scenes, with different levels of reflection, transparency, and lighting.

|**2023-12-24**|**SUNDIAL: 3D Satellite Understanding through Direct, Ambient, and Complex Lighting Decomposition**|3D modeling from satellite imagery is essential in areas of environmental science, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster response. However, traditional 3D modeling techniques face unique challenges in the remote sensing context, including limited multi-view baselines over extensive regions, varying direct, ambient, and complex illumination conditions, and time-varying scene changes across captures. In this work, we introduce SUNDIAL, a comprehensive approach to 3D reconstruction of satellite imagery using neural radiance fields. We jointly learn satellite scene geometry, illumination components, and sun direction in this single-model approach, and propose a secondary shadow ray casting technique to 1) improve scene geometry using oblique sun angles to render shadows, 2) enable physically-based disentanglement of scene albedo and illumination, and 3) determine the components of illumination from direct, ambient (sky), and complex sources. To achieve this, we incorporate lighting cues and geometric priors from remote sensing literature in a neural rendering approach, modeling physical properties of satellite scenes such as shadows, scattered sky illumination, and complex illumination and shading of vegetation and water. We evaluate the performance of SUNDIAL against existing NeRF-based techniques for satellite scene modeling and demonstrate improved scene and lighting disentanglement, novel view and lighting rendering, and geometry and sun direction estimation on challenging scenes with small baselines, sparse inputs, and variable illumination. et.al.|[2312.16215](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16215)|null|
|**2023-12-23**|**INFAMOUS-NeRF: ImproviNg FAce MOdeling Using Semantically-Aligned Hypernetworks with Neural Radiance Fields**|We propose INFAMOUS-NeRF, an implicit morphable face model that introduces hypernetworks to NeRF to improve the representation power in the presence of many training subjects. At the same time, INFAMOUS-NeRF resolves the classic hypernetwork tradeoff of representation power and editability by learning semantically-aligned latent spaces despite the subject-specific models, all without requiring a large pretrained model. INFAMOUS-NeRF further introduces a novel constraint to improve NeRF rendering along the face boundary. Our constraint can leverage photometric surface rendering and multi-view supervision to guide surface color prediction and improve rendering near the surface. Finally, we introduce a novel, loss-guided adaptive sampling method for more effective NeRF training by reducing the sampling redundancy. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our method achieves higher representation power than prior face modeling methods in both controlled and in-the-wild settings. Code and models will be released upon publication. et.al.|[2312.16197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16197)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**LangSplat: 3D Language Gaussian Splatting**|Human lives in a 3D world and commonly uses natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 3D object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably, LangSplat is extremely efficient, achieving a {\speed} $\times$ speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 $\times$ 1080.

|**2023-12-26**|**2D-Guided 3D Gaussian Segmentation**|Recently, 3D Gaussian, as an explicit 3D representation method, has demonstrated strong competitiveness over NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) in terms of expressing complex scenes and training duration. These advantages signal a wide range of applications for 3D Gaussians in 3D understanding and editing. Meanwhile, the segmentation of 3D Gaussians is still in its infancy. The existing segmentation methods are not only cumbersome but also incapable of segmenting multiple objects simultaneously in a short amount of time. In response, this paper introduces a 3D Gaussian segmentation method implemented with 2D segmentation as supervision. This approach uses input 2D segmentation maps to guide the learning of the added 3D Gaussian semantic information, while nearest neighbor clustering and statistical filtering refine the segmentation results. Experiments show that our concise method can achieve comparable performances on mIOU and mAcc for multi-object segmentation as previous single-object segmentation methods. et.al.|[2312.16047](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16047)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**Pano-NeRF: Synthesizing High Dynamic Range Novel Views with Geometry from Sparse Low Dynamic Range Panoramic Images**|Panoramic imaging research on geometry recovery and High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction becomes a trend with the development of Extended Reality (XR). Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) provide a promising scene representation for both tasks without requiring extensive prior data. However, in the case of inputting sparse Low Dynamic Range (LDR) panoramic images, NeRF often degrades with under-constrained geometry and is unable to reconstruct HDR radiance from LDR inputs. We observe that the radiance from each pixel in panoramic images can be modeled as both a signal to convey scene lighting information and a light source to illuminate other pixels. Hence, we propose the irradiance fields from sparse LDR panoramic images, which increases the observation counts for faithful geometry recovery and leverages the irradiance-radiance attenuation for HDR reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the irradiance fields outperform state-of-the-art methods on both geometry recovery and HDR reconstruction and validate their effectiveness. Furthermore, we show a promising byproduct of spatially-varying lighting estimation.

|**2023-12-23**|**Human101: Training 100+FPS Human Gaussians in 100s from 1 View**|Reconstructing the human body from single-view videos plays a pivotal role in the virtual reality domain. One prevalent application scenario necessitates the rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity 3D digital humans while simultaneously ensuring real-time rendering and interaction. Existing methods often struggle to fulfill both requirements. In this paper, we introduce Human101, a novel framework adept at producing high-fidelity dynamic 3D human reconstructions from 1-view videos by training 3D Gaussians in 100 seconds and rendering in 100+ FPS. Our method leverages the strengths of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which provides an explicit and efficient representation of 3D humans. Standing apart from prior NeRF-based pipelines, Human101 ingeniously applies a Human-centric Forward Gaussian Animation method to deform the parameters of 3D Gaussians, thereby enhancing rendering speed (i.e., rendering 1024-resolution images at an impressive 60+ FPS and rendering 512-resolution images at 100+ FPS). Experimental results indicate that our approach substantially eclipses current methods, clocking up to a 10 times surge in frames per second and delivering comparable or superior rendering quality.

|**2023-12-23**|**Efficient Deformable Tissue Reconstruction via Orthogonal Neural Plane**|Intraoperative imaging techniques for reconstructing deformable tissues in vivo are pivotal for advanced surgical systems. Existing methods either compromise on rendering quality or are excessively computationally intensive, often demanding dozens of hours to perform, which significantly hinders their practical application. In this paper, we introduce Fast Orthogonal Plane (Forplane), a novel, efficient framework based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the reconstruction of deformable tissues. We conceptualize surgical procedures as 4D volumes, and break them down into static and dynamic fields comprised of orthogonal neural planes. This factorization iscretizes the four-dimensional space, leading to a decreased memory usage and faster optimization. A spatiotemporal importance sampling scheme is introduced to improve performance in regions with tool occlusion as well as large motions and accelerate training. An efficient ray marching method is applied to skip sampling among empty regions, significantly improving inference speed. Forplane accommodates both binocular and monocular endoscopy videos, demonstrating its extensive applicability and flexibility. Our experiments, carried out on two in vivo datasets, the EndoNeRF and Hamlyn datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. In all cases, Forplane substantially accelerates both the optimization process (by over 100 times) and the inference process (by over 15 times) while maintaining or even improving the quality across a variety of non-rigid deformations. This significant performance improvement promises to be a valuable asset for future intraoperative surgical applications.

|**2023-12-23**|**CaLDiff: Camera Localization in NeRF via Pose Diffusion**|With the widespread use of NeRF-based implicit 3D representation, the need for camera localization in the same representation becomes manifestly apparent. Doing so not only simplifies the localization process -- by avoiding an outside-the-NeRF-based localization -- but also has the potential to offer the benefit of enhanced localization. This paper studies the problem of localizing cameras in NeRF using a diffusion model for camera pose adjustment. More specifically, given a pre-trained NeRF model, we train a diffusion model that iteratively updates randomly initialized camera poses, conditioned upon the image to be localized. At test time, a new camera is localized in two steps: first, coarse localization using the proposed pose diffusion process, followed by local refinement steps of a pose inversion process in NeRF. In fact, the proposed camera localization by pose diffusion (CaLDiff) method also integrates the pose inversion steps within the diffusion process. Such integration offers significantly better localization, thanks to our downstream refinement-aware diffusion process. Our exhaustive experiments on challenging real-world data validate our method by providing significantly better results than the compared methods and the established baselines. Our source code will be made publicly available. et.al.|[2312.15242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15242)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**PoseGen: Learning to Generate 3D Human Pose Dataset with NeRF**|This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for generating 3D human pose datasets using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Public datasets generally have limited diversity in terms of human poses and camera viewpoints, largely due to the resource-intensive nature of collecting 3D human pose data. As a result, pose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when applied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed augmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large amount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or result in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen, which learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback loss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our generated data is optimized to improve the robustness of the pre-trained model. The objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the prediction error of a given pre-trained model. As the learned data distribution contains OOD samples of the pre-trained model, sampling data from such a distribution for further fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves the generalizability of the model. This is the first work that proposes NeRFs for 3D human data generation. NeRFs are data-driven and do not require 3D scans of humans. Therefore, using NeRF for data generation is a new direction for convenient user-specific data generation. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed PoseGen improves two baseline models (SPIN and HybrIK) on four datasets with an average 6% relative improvement. et.al.|[2312.14915](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14915)|**[link](https://github.com/mgholamikn/PoseGen)**|
|**2023-12-22**|**Density Uncertainty Quantification with NeRF-Ensembles: Impact of Data and Scene Constraints**|In the fields of computer graphics, computer vision and photogrammetry, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a major topic driving current research and development. However, the quality of NeRF-generated 3D scene reconstructions and subsequent surface reconstructions, heavily relies on the network output, particularly the density. Regarding this critical aspect, we propose to utilize NeRF-Ensembles that provide a density uncertainty estimate alongside the mean density. We demonstrate that data constraints such as low-quality images and poses lead to a degradation of the training process, increased density uncertainty and decreased predicted density. Even with high-quality input data, the density uncertainty varies based on scene constraints such as acquisition constellations, occlusions and material properties. NeRF-Ensembles not only provide a tool for quantifying the uncertainty but exhibit two promising advantages: Enhanced robustness and artifact removal. Through the utilization of NeRF-Ensembles instead of single NeRFs, small outliers are removed, yielding a smoother output with improved completeness of structures. Furthermore, applying percentile-based thresholds on density uncertainty outliers proves to be effective for the removal of large (foggy) artifacts in post-processing. We conduct our methodology on 3 different datasets: (i) synthetic benchmark dataset, (ii) real benchmark dataset, (iii) real data under realistic recording conditions and sensors. et.al.|[2312.14664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14664)|null|
|**2023-12-21**|**PlatoNeRF: 3D Reconstruction in Plato's Cave via Single-View Two-Bounce Lidar**|3D reconstruction from a single-view is challenging because of the ambiguity from monocular cues and lack of information about occluded regions. Neural radiance fields (NeRF), while popular for view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, are typically reliant on multi-view images. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction with NeRF rely on either data priors to hallucinate views of occluded regions, which may not be physically accurate, or shadows observed by RGB cameras, which are difficult to detect in ambient light and low albedo backgrounds. We propose using time-of-flight data captured by a single-photon avalanche diode to overcome these limitations. Our method models two-bounce optical paths with NeRF, using lidar transient data for supervision. By leveraging the advantages of both NeRF and two-bounce light measured by lidar, we demonstrate that we can reconstruct visible and occluded geometry without data priors or reliance on controlled ambient lighting or scene albedo. In addition, we demonstrate improved generalization under practical constraints on sensor spatial- and temporal-resolution. We believe our method is a promising direction as single-photon lidars become ubiquitous on consumer devices, such as phones, tablets, and headsets. et.al.|[2312.14239](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14239)|null|

To circumvent the limited availability of 3D motion data aligned with environmental geometry, we leverage monocular internet videos and extract deformable NeRF representations for the foreground and static NeRF representations for the background. For this, we develop a reconstruction strategy, encompassing species-level shared template learning and per-video fine-tuning. Utilizing the reconstructed data, we then train a conditional 3D motion model to learn the trajectory and articulation of foreground animals in the context of 3D backgrounds. We showcase the efficacy of our pipeline with comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations using cat videos. We also demonstrate versatility across unseen cats and indoor environments, producing temporally coherent 4D outputs for enriched virtual experiences. et.al.|[2312.14154](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14154)|null|
|**2023-12-21**|**Carve3D: Improving Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency for Diffusion Models with RL Finetuning**|Recent advancements in the text-to-3D task leverage finetuned text-to-image diffusion models to generate multi-view images, followed by NeRF reconstruction. Yet, existing supervised finetuned (SFT) diffusion models still suffer from multi-view inconsistency and the resulting NeRF artifacts. Although training longer with SFT improves consistency, it also causes distribution shift, which reduces diversity and realistic details. We argue that the SFT of multi-view diffusion models resembles the instruction finetuning stage of the LLM alignment pipeline and can benefit from RL finetuning (RLFT) methods. Essentially, RLFT methods optimize models beyond their SFT data distribution by using their own outputs, effectively mitigating distribution shift. To this end, we introduce Carve3D, a RLFT method coupled with the Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric, to improve the consistency of multi-view diffusion models. To compute MRC on a set of multi-view images, we compare them with their corresponding renderings of the reconstructed NeRF at the same viewpoints. We validate the robustness of MRC with extensive experiments conducted under controlled inconsistency levels. We enhance the base RLFT algorithm to stabilize the training process, reduce distribution shift, and identify scaling laws. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, along with a user study, we demonstrate Carve3D's improved multi-view consistency, the resulting superior NeRF reconstruction quality, and minimal distribution shift compared to longer SFT.

We chose four different animals, including the oriental stork, frog, dragonfly, and tiger, as our subjects for this study. Our results show that the combination of SyncDreamer, NeRF, and NeuS techniques can successfully create 3D models of endangered animals. However, we also observed that NeuS produced blurry images, while NeRF generated sharper but noisier images. This study highlights the potential of modeling endangered animals and offers a new direction for future research in this field.

|**2023-12-22**|**Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar renders quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. We encode information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and neural network, which takes parameters of Gaussian and viewing direction to produce changes in color and opacity. Consequently, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and transparency of 3D objects. et.al.|[2312.13729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729)|**[link](https://github.com/gmum/ViewingDirectionGaussianSplatting)**|

Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static scenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis. However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion Decomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. Our DyBluRF is the first that addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays prediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DyBluRF outperforms qualitatively and quantitatively the very recent state-of-the-art methods.

Such models can also serve for generating training data for machine learning approaches in settings where data is difficult to obtain or where too few training data exists, e.g. by providing novel views or images in varying conditions. While the vast amount of visual 3D reconstruction approaches focus on non-physical models, textured object surfaces or shapes, in this contribution we propose a volumetric reconstruction approach that obtains a physical model including the interior of partially translucent objects such as plankton or insects. Our technique photographs the object under different poses in front of a bright white light source and computes absorption and scattering per voxel. It can be interpreted as visual tomography that we solve by inverse raytracing. We additionally suggest a method to convert non-physical NeRF media into a physically-based volumetric grid for initialization and illustrate the usefulness of the approach using two real-world plankton validation sets, the lab-scanned models being finally also relighted and virtually submerged in a scenario with augmented medium and illumination conditions.

Our system initializes camera poses using sparse visual odometry and obtains view-dependent dense geometry priors from a monocular depth prediction network. We harmonize the scale of poses and dense geometry, treating them as supervisory cues to train a neural implicit scene representation. NeRF-VO demonstrates exceptional performance in both photometric and geometric fidelity of the scene representation by jointly optimizing a sliding window of keyframed poses and the underlying dense geometry, which is accomplished through training the radiance field with volume rendering. We surpass state-of-the-art methods in pose estimation accuracy, novel view synthesis fidelity, and dense reconstruction quality across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, while achieving a higher camera tracking frequency and consuming less GPU memory. et.al.|[2312.13471](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13471)|null|

However, we observed that this property is not followed by the existing RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. Therefore, we are motivated to introduce this prior into the RGB-only NeRF-SLAM pipeline. Unfortunately, the optimization through the volumetric rendering function does not facilitate easy integration of the desired prior. Instead, we observed that the opacity of ternary-type (TT) is well supported. In this work, we study why ternary-type opacity is well-suited and desired for the task at hand. In particular, we provide theoretical insights into the process of jointly optimizing radiance and opacity through the volumetric rendering process. Through exhaustive experiments on benchmark datasets, we validate our claim and provide insights into the optimization process, which we believe will unleash the potential of RGB-only NeRF-SLAM. To foster this line of research, we also propose a simple yet novel visual odometry scheme that uses a hybrid combination of volumetric and warping-based image renderings. More specifically, the proposed hybrid odometry (HO) additionally uses image warping-based coarse odometry, leading up to an order of magnitude final speed-up. Furthermore, we show that the proposed TT and HO well complement each other, offering state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in terms of both speed and accuracy. et.al.|[2312.13332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332)|null|

Previous methods using 2D diffusion priors to optimize neural radiance fields for generating room-scale scenes have shown unsatisfactory quality. This is primarily attributed to the limitations of 2D priors lacking 3D awareness and constraints in the training methodology. In this paper, we utilize a 3D diffusion prior, MVDiffusion, to optimize the 3D room-scale scene. Our contributions are in two aspects. Firstly, we propose a progressive view selection process to optimize NeRF. This involves dividing the training process into three stages, gradually expanding the camera sampling scope. Secondly, we propose the pose transformation method in the second stage. It will ensure MVDiffusion provide the accurate view guidance. As a result, ShowRoom3D enables the generation of rooms with improved structural integrity, enhanced clarity from any view, reduced content repetition, and higher consistency across different perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of user study. et.al.|[2312.13324](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13324)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**UniSDF: Unifying Neural Representations for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction of Complex Scenes with Reflections**|Neural 3D scene representations have shown great potential for 3D reconstruction from 2D images. However, reconstructing real-world captures of complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we observe that these methods are often not robust in real unbounded scenarios where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both view-based as well as reflection-based color prediction parameterization techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate, especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF 360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly reconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective surfaces.

|**2023-12-20**|**Reducing Shape-Radiance Ambiguity in Radiance Fields with a Closed-Form Color Estimation Method**|Neural radiance field (NeRF) enables the synthesis of cutting-edge realistic novel view images of a 3D scene. It includes density and color fields to model the shape and radiance of a scene, respectively. Supervised by the photometric loss in an end-to-end training manner, NeRF inherently suffers from the shape-radiance ambiguity problem, i.e., it can perfectly fit training views but does not guarantee decoupling the two fields correctly. To deal with this issue, existing works have incorporated prior knowledge to provide an independent supervision signal for the density field, including total variation loss, sparsity loss, distortion loss, etc. These losses are based on general assumptions about the density field, e.g., it should be smooth, sparse, or compact, which are not adaptive to a specific scene. In this paper, we propose a more adaptive method to reduce the shape-radiance ambiguity. The key is a rendering method that is only based on the density field. Specifically, we first estimate the color field based on the density field and posed images in a closed form. Then NeRF's rendering process can proceed. We address the problems in estimating the color field, including occlusion and non-uniformly distributed views. Afterward, it is applied to regularize NeRF's density field. As our regularization is guided by photometric loss, it is more adaptive compared to existing ones. Experimental results show that our method improves the density field of NeRF both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, it is challenging for NeRF to synthesize high-quality high-resolution novel views with low-resolution training data. To solve this problem, we propose a zero-shot super-resolution training framework for NeRF. This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel views via single-scene internal learning rather than requiring any external high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the super-resolution 3D sampling space. Then, we further introduce a temporal ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume high-resolution views or additional scene data to train super-resolution NeRF; (2) it can speed up the training process by adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy. By conducting extensive experiments on public datasets, we have qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. et.al.|[2312.12122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12122)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**LHManip: A Dataset for Long-Horizon Language-Grounded Manipulation Tasks in Cluttered Tabletop Environments**|Instructing a robot to complete an everyday task within our homes has been a long-standing challenge for robotics. While recent progress in language-conditioned imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning has demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, they are typically limited to short-horizon tasks -- not reflective of those a home robot would be expected to complete. While existing architectures have the potential to learn these desired behaviours, the lack of the necessary long-horizon, multi-step datasets for real robotic systems poses a significant challenge. To this end, we present the Long-Horizon Manipulation (LHManip) dataset comprising 200 episodes, demonstrating 20 different manipulation tasks via real robot teleoperation. The tasks entail multiple sub-tasks, including grasping, pushing, stacking and throwing objects in highly cluttered environments. Each task is paired with a natural language instruction and multi-camera viewpoints for point-cloud or NeRF reconstruction. In total, the dataset comprises 176,278 observation-action pairs which form part of the Open X-Embodiment dataset. The full LHManip dataset is made publicly available at https://github.com/fedeceola/LHManip. et.al.|[2312.12036](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12036)|**[link](https://github.com/fedeceola/lhmanip)**|
|**2023-12-20**|**MixRT: Mixed Neural Representations For Real-Time NeRF Rendering**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a leading technique for novel view synthesis, owing to its impressive photorealistic reconstruction and rendering capability. Nevertheless, achieving real-time NeRF rendering in large-scale scenes has presented challenges, often leading to the adoption of either intricate baked mesh representations with a substantial number of triangles or resource-intensive ray marching in baked representations. We challenge these conventions, observing that high-quality geometry, represented by meshes with substantial triangles, is not necessary for achieving photorealistic rendering quality. Consequently, we propose MixRT, a novel NeRF representation that includes a low-quality mesh, a view-dependent displacement map, and a compressed NeRF model. This design effectively harnesses the capabilities of existing graphics hardware, thus enabling real-time NeRF rendering on edge devices. Leveraging a highly-optimized WebGL-based rendering framework, our proposed MixRT attains real-time rendering speeds on edge devices (over 30 FPS at a resolution of 1280 x 720 on a MacBook M1 Pro laptop), better rendering quality (0.2 PSNR higher in indoor scenes of the Unbounded-360 datasets), and a smaller storage size (less than 80% compared to state-of-the-art methods). et.al.|[2312.11841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11841)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Text-Image Conditioned Diffusion for Consistent Text-to-3D Generation**|By lifting the pre-trained 2D diffusion models into Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), text-to-3D generation methods have made great progress. Many state-of-the-art approaches usually apply score distillation sampling (SDS) to optimize the NeRF representations, which supervises the NeRF optimization with pre-trained text-conditioned 2D diffusion models such as Imagen. However, the supervision signal provided by such pre-trained diffusion models only depends on text prompts and does not constrain the multi-view consistency. To inject the cross-view consistency into diffusion priors, some recent works finetune the 2D diffusion model with multi-view data, but still lack fine-grained view coherence. To tackle this challenge, we incorporate multi-view image conditions into the supervision signal of NeRF optimization, which explicitly enforces fine-grained view consistency. With such stronger supervision, our proposed text-to-3D method effectively mitigates the generation of floaters (due to excessive densities) and completely empty spaces (due to insufficient densities). Our quantitative evaluations on the T $^3$ Bench dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing text-to-3D methods. We will make the code publicly available. et.al.|[2312.11774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11774)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**FastSR-NeRF: Improving NeRF Efficiency on Consumer Devices with A Simple Super-Resolution Pipeline**|Super-resolution (SR) techniques have recently been proposed to upscale the outputs of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and generate high-quality images with enhanced inference speeds. However, existing NeRF+SR methods increase training overhead by using extra input features, loss functions, and/or expensive training procedures such as knowledge distillation. In this paper, we aim to leverage SR for efficiency gains without costly training or architectural changes. Specifically, we build a simple NeRF+SR pipeline that directly combines existing modules, and we propose a lightweight augmentation technique, random patch sampling, for training. Compared to existing NeRF+SR methods, our pipeline mitigates the SR computing overhead and can be trained up to 23x faster, making it feasible to run on consumer devices such as the Apple MacBook. Experiments show our pipeline can upscale NeRF outputs by 2-4x while maintaining high quality, increasing inference speeds by up to 18x on an NVIDIA V100 GPU and 12.8x on an M1 Pro chip. We conclude that SR can be a simple but effective technique for improving the efficiency of NeRF models for consumer devices. et.al.|[2312.11537](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11537)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Customize-It-3D: High-Quality 3D Creation from A Single Image Using Subject-Specific Knowledge Prior**|In this paper, we present a novel two-stage approach that fully utilizes the information provided by the reference image to establish a customized knowledge prior for image-to-3D generation. While previous approaches primarily rely on a general diffusion prior, which struggles to yield consistent results with the reference image, we propose a subject-specific and multi-modal diffusion model. This model not only aids NeRF optimization by considering the shading mode for improved geometry but also enhances texture from the coarse results to achieve superior refinement. Both aspects contribute to faithfully aligning the 3D content with the subject. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method, Customize-It-3D, outperforming previous works by a substantial margin. It produces faithful 360-degree reconstructions with impressive visual quality, making it well-suited for various applications, including text-to-3D creation. et.al.|[2312.11535](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11535)|null|
|**2023-12-18**|**GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning**|Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution. et.al.|[2312.11461](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461)|null|
|**2023-12-18**|**AE-NeRF: Audio Enhanced Neural Radiance Field for Few Shot Talking Head Synthesis**|Audio-driven talking head synthesis is a promising topic with wide applications in digital human, film making and virtual reality. Recent NeRF-based approaches have shown superiority in quality and fidelity compared to previous studies. However, when it comes to few-shot talking head generation, a practical scenario where only few seconds of talking video is available for one identity, two limitations emerge: 1) they either have no base model, which serves as a facial prior for fast convergence, or ignore the importance of audio when building the prior; 2) most of them overlook the degree of correlation between different face regions and audio, e.g., mouth is audio related, while ear is audio independent. In this paper, we present Audio Enhanced Neural Radiance Field (AE-NeRF) to tackle the above issues, which can generate realistic portraits of a new speaker with fewshot dataset. Specifically, we introduce an Audio Aware Aggregation module into the feature fusion stage of the reference scheme, where the weight is determined by the similarity of audio between reference and target image. Then, an Audio-Aligned Face Generation strategy is proposed to model the audio related and audio independent regions respectively, with a dual-NeRF framework. Extensive experiments have shown AE-NeRF surpasses the state-of-the-art on image fidelity, audio-lip synchronization, and generalization ability, even in limited training set or training iterations. et.al.|[2312.10921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10921)|null|
|**2023-12-17**|**PNeRFLoc: Visual Localization with Point-based Neural Radiance Fields**|Due to the ability to synthesize high-quality novel views, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been recently exploited to improve visual localization in a known environment. However, the existing methods mostly utilize NeRFs for data augmentation to improve the regression model training, and the performance on novel viewpoints and appearances is still limited due to the lack of geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel visual localization framework, \ie, PNeRFLoc, based on a unified point-based representation. On the one hand, PNeRFLoc supports the initial pose estimation by matching 2D and 3D feature points as traditional structure-based methods; on the other hand, it also enables pose refinement with novel view synthesis using rendering-based optimization. Specifically, we propose a novel feature adaption module to close the gaps between the features for visual localization and neural rendering. To improve the efficacy and efficiency of neural rendering-based optimization, we also develop an efficient rendering-based framework with a warping loss function. Furthermore, several robustness techniques are developed to handle illumination changes and dynamic objects for outdoor scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that PNeRFLoc performs the best on synthetic data when the NeRF model can be well learned and performs on par with the SOTA method on the visual localization benchmark datasets. et.al.|[2312.10649](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10649)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Learning Dense Correspondence for NeRF-Based Face Reenactment**|Face reenactment is challenging due to the need to establish dense correspondence between various face representations for motion transfer. Recent studies have utilized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as fundamental representation, which further enhanced the performance of multi-view face reenactment in photo-realism and 3D consistency. However, establishing dense correspondence between different face NeRFs is non-trivial, because implicit representations lack ground-truth correspondence annotations like mesh-based 3D parametric models (e.g., 3DMM) with index-aligned vertexes. Although aligning 3DMM space with NeRF-based face representations can realize motion control, it is sub-optimal for their limited face-only modeling and low identity fidelity. Therefore, we are inspired to ask: Can we learn the dense correspondence between different NeRF-based face representations without a 3D parametric model prior? To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, which adopts tri-planes as fundamental NeRF representation and decomposes face tri-planes into three components: canonical tri-planes, identity deformations, and motion. In terms of motion control, our key contribution is proposing a Plane Dictionary (PlaneDict) module, which efficiently maps the motion conditions to a linear weighted addition of learnable orthogonal plane bases. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first method that achieves one-shot multi-view face reenactment without a 3D parametric model prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we produce better results in fine-grained motion control and identity preservation than previous methods. et.al.|[2312.10422](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10422)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**SlimmeRF: Slimmable Radiance Fields**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have recently emerged as successful methods for novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, most current NeRF models either achieve high accuracy using large model sizes, or achieve high memory-efficiency by trading off accuracy. This limits the applicable scope of any single model, since high-accuracy models might not fit in low-memory devices, and memory-efficient models might not satisfy high-quality requirements. To this end, we present SlimmeRF, a model that allows for instant test-time trade-offs between model size and accuracy through slimming, thus making the model simultaneously suitable for scenarios with different computing budgets. We achieve this through a newly proposed algorithm named Tensorial Rank Incrementation (TRaIn) which increases the rank of the model's tensorial representation gradually during training. We also observe that our model allows for more effective trade-offs in sparse-view scenarios, at times even achieving higher accuracy after being slimmed. We credit this to the fact that erroneous information such as floaters tend to be stored in components corresponding to higher ranks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Shiran-Yuan/SlimmeRF. et.al.|[2312.10034](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10034)|**[link](https://github.com/shiran-yuan/slimmerf)**|
|**2023-12-15**|**LAENeRF: Local Appearance Editing for Neural Radiance Fields**|Due to the omnipresence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the interest towards editable implicit 3D representations has surged over the last years. However, editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the model parameters. Despite these challenges, recent research has shown first promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits. The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity, a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements, rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF, a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing, we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color, which can optionally be supervised by a style loss, resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping, we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity, we compose the output color using a set of learned, modifiable base colors, composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work, LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. et.al.|[2312.09913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09913)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**SLS4D: Sparse Latent Space for 4D Novel View Synthesis**|Neural radiance field (NeRF) has achieved great success in novel view synthesis and 3D representation for static scenarios. Existing dynamic NeRFs usually exploit a locally dense grid to fit the deformation field; however, they fail to capture the global dynamics and concomitantly yield models of heavy parameters. We observe that the 4D space is inherently sparse. Firstly, the deformation field is sparse in spatial but dense in temporal due to the continuity of of motion. Secondly, the radiance field is only valid on the surface of the underlying scene, usually occupying a small fraction of the whole space. We thus propose to represent the 4D scene using a learnable sparse latent space, a.k.a. SLS4D. Specifically, SLS4D first uses dense learnable time slot features to depict the temporal space, from which the deformation field is fitted with linear multi-layer perceptions (MLP) to predict the displacement of a 3D position at any time. It then learns the spatial features of a 3D position using another sparse latent space. This is achieved by learning the adaptive weights of each latent code with the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLS4D: it achieves the best 4D novel view synthesis using only about $6\%$ parameters of the most recent work. et.al.|[2312.09743](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09743)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Towards Transferable Targeted 3D Adversarial Attack in the Physical World**|Compared with transferable untargeted attacks, transferable targeted adversarial attacks could specify the misclassification categories of adversarial samples, posing a greater threat to security-critical tasks. In the meanwhile, 3D adversarial samples, due to their potential of multi-view robustness, can more comprehensively identify weaknesses in existing deep learning systems, possessing great application value. However, the field of transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples, filling the gap in this field. To achieve this goal, we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima, leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions, TT3D innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space, which significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness. Experimental results show that TT3D not only exhibits superior cross-model transferability but also maintains considerable adaptability across different renders and vision tasks. More importantly, we produce 3D adversarial examples with 3D printing techniques in the real world and verify their robust performance under various scenarios. et.al.|[2312.09558](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09558)|null|
|**2023-12-14**|**LatentEditor: Text Driven Local Editing of 3D Scenes**|While neural fields have made significant strides in view synthesis and scene reconstruction, editing them poses a formidable challenge due to their implicit encoding of geometry and texture information from multi-view inputs. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{LatentEditor}, an innovative framework designed to empower users with the ability to perform precise and locally controlled editing of neural fields using text prompts. Leveraging denoising diffusion models, we successfully embed real-world scenes into the latent space, resulting in a faster and more adaptable NeRF backbone for editing compared to traditional methods. To enhance editing precision, we introduce a delta score to calculate the 2D mask in the latent space that serves as a guide for local modifications while preserving irrelevant regions. Our novel pixel-level scoring approach harnesses the power of InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) to discern the disparity between IP2P conditional and unconditional noise predictions in the latent space. The edited latents conditioned on the 2D masks are then iteratively updated in the training set to achieve 3D local editing. Our approach achieves faster editing speeds and superior output quality compared to existing 3D editing models, bridging the gap between textual instructions and high-quality 3D scene editing in latent space. We show the superiority of our approach on four benchmark 3D datasets, LLFF, IN2N, NeRFStudio and NeRF-Art. et.al.|[2312.09313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09313)|**[link](https://github.com/umarkhalidAI/LatentEditor)**|

However, a comprehensive understanding of the SDS formulation is still lacking, hindering the development of 3D generation. In this work, we present an interpretation of SDS as a combination of three functional components: mode-disengaging, mode-seeking and variance-reducing terms, and analyze the properties of each. We show that problems such as over-smoothness and color-saturation result from the intrinsic deficiency of the supervision terms and reveal that the variance-reducing term introduced by SDS is sub-optimal. Additionally, we shed light on the adoption of large Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scale for 3D generation. Based on the analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach named Stable Score Distillation (SSD) which strategically orchestrates each term for high-quality 3D generation. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fidelity 3D content without succumbing to issues such as over-smoothness and over-saturation, even under low CFG conditions with the most challenging NeRF representation. et.al.|[2312.09305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09305)|null|

Current breakthroughs like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated high-fidelity image synthesis but struggle with sparse input views. Existing methods, such as Generalizable NeRFs and per-scene optimization approaches, face limitations in data dependency, computational cost, and generalization across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose ZeroRF, whose key idea is to integrate a tailored Deep Image Prior into a factorized NeRF representation. Unlike traditional methods, ZeroRF parametrizes feature grids with a neural network generator, enabling efficient sparse view 360{\deg} reconstruction without any pretraining or additional regularization. Extensive experiments showcase ZeroRF's versatility and superiority in terms of both quality and speed, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Existing methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality novel-view/novel-pose image synthesis but often require days of training, and are extremely slow at inference time. Recently, the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training, these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper, we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS). Given the explicit nature of our representation, we further introduce as-isometric-as-possible regularizations on both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices, enhancing the generalization of our model on highly articulated unseen poses. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable and even better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on animatable avatar creation from a monocular input, while being 400x and 250x faster in training and inference, respectively. et.al.|[2312.09228](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**ColNeRF: Collaboration for Generalizable Sparse Input Neural Radiance Field**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive potential in synthesizing novel views from dense input, however, their effectiveness is challenged when dealing with sparse input. Existing approaches that incorporate additional depth or semantic supervision can alleviate this issue to an extent. However, the process of supervision collection is not only costly but also potentially inaccurate, leading to poor performance and generalization ability in diverse scenarios. In our work, we introduce a novel model: the Collaborative Neural Radiance Fields (ColNeRF) designed to work with sparse input. The collaboration in ColNeRF includes both the cooperation between sparse input images and the cooperation between the output of the neural radiation field. Through this, we construct a novel collaborative module that aligns information from various views and meanwhile imposes self-supervised constraints to ensure multi-view consistency in both geometry and appearance. A Collaborative Cross-View Volume Integration module (CCVI) is proposed to capture complex occlusions and implicitly infer the spatial location of objects. Moreover, we introduce self-supervision of target rays projected in multiple directions to ensure geometric and color consistency in adjacent regions. Benefiting from the collaboration at the input and output ends, ColNeRF is capable of capturing richer and more generalized scene representation, thereby facilitating higher-quality results of the novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ColNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art sparse input generalizable NeRF methods. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superiority in fine-tuning towards adapting to new scenes, achieving competitive performance compared to per-scene optimized NeRF-based methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

This simplified rendering approach presents challenges in accurately modeling images captured under adverse lighting conditions, such as low light or over-exposure. Motivated by the ancient Greek emission theory that posits visual perception as a result of rays emanating from the eyes, we slightly refine the conventional NeRF framework to train NeRF under challenging light conditions and generate normal-light condition novel views unsupervised. We introduce the concept of a "Concealing Field," which assigns transmittance values to the surrounding air to account for illumination effects. In dark scenarios, we assume that object emissions maintain a standard lighting level but are attenuated as they traverse the air during the rendering process. Concealing Field thus compel NeRF to learn reasonable density and colour estimations for objects even in dimly lit situations. Similarly, the Concealing Field can mitigate over-exposed emissions during the rendering stage. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive multi-view dataset captured under challenging illumination conditions for evaluation.

The conventional pose estimation methods typically rely on the target's CAD model or necessitate specific network training tailored to particular object classes. Some existing methods address mesh-free 6D pose estimation by employing the inversion of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), aiming to overcome the aforementioned constraints. However, it still suffers from adverse initializations. By contrast, we model the pose estimation as the problem of inverting the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both the comparing and matching loss. In detail, a render-and-compare strategy is adopted for the precise estimation of poses. Additionally, a matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness against adverse initializations by minimizing the distances between 2D keypoints. This framework systematically incorporates the distinctive characteristics and inherent rationale of render-and-compare and matching-based approaches. This comprehensive consideration equips the framework to effectively address a broader range of intricate and challenging scenarios, including instances with substantial angular deviations, all while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superior precision and robustness of our proposed jointly optimized framework when evaluated on synthetic and complex real-world data in challenging scenarios. et.al.|[2312.09031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031)|null|

Subsequently, we perform keyframe selection on the video frames to optimize resource utilization and eliminate the impact of dynamic objects on the reconstruction results.

|**2023-12-14**|**CF-NeRF: Camera Parameter Free Neural Radiance Fields with Incremental Learning**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis. However, NeRF and most of its variants still rely on traditional complex pipelines to provide extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, such as COLMAP. Recent works, like NeRFmm, BARF, and L2G-NeRF, directly treat camera parameters as learnable and estimate them through differential volume rendering. However, these methods work for forward-looking scenes with slight motions and fail to tackle the rotation scenario in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \underline{c}amera parameter \underline{f}ree neural radiance field (CF-NeRF), which incrementally reconstructs 3D representations and recovers the camera parameters inspired by incremental structure from motion (SfM). Given a sequence of images, CF-NeRF estimates the camera parameters of images one by one and reconstructs the scene through initialization, implicit localization, and implicit optimization. To evaluate our method, we use a challenging real-world dataset NeRFBuster which provides 12 scenes under complex trajectories. Results demonstrate that CF-NeRF is robust to camera rotation and achieves state-of-the-art results without providing prior information and constraints. et.al.|[2312.08760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08760)|null|

We modify the classical spectral rendering into two main steps, 1) the generation of a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths, 2) the combination of these spectrum maps for the RGB output. Our SpectralNeRF follows these two steps through the proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture (SpectralMLP) and Spectrum Attention UNet (SAUNet). Given the ray origin and the ray direction, the SpectralMLP constructs the spectral radiance field to obtain spectrum maps of novel views, which are then sent to the SAUNet to produce RGB images of white-light illumination. Applying NeRF to build up the spectral rendering is a more physically-based way from the perspective of ray-tracing. Further, the spectral radiance fields decompose difficult scenes and improve the performance of NeRF-based methods.

|**2023-12-13**|**ProNeRF: Learning Efficient Projection-Aware Ray Sampling for Fine-Grained Implicit Neural Radiance Fields**|Recent advances in neural rendering have shown that, albeit slow, implicit compact models can learn a scene's geometries and view-dependent appearances from multiple views. To maintain such a small memory footprint but achieve faster inference times, recent works have adopted `sampler' networks that adaptively sample a small subset of points along each ray in the implicit neural radiance fields. Although these methods achieve up to a 10 $\times$ reduction in rendering time, they still suffer from considerable quality degradation compared to the vanilla NeRF. In contrast, we propose ProNeRF, which provides an optimal trade-off between memory footprint (similar to NeRF), speed (faster than HyperReel), and quality (better than K-Planes). ProNeRF is equipped with a novel projection-aware sampling (PAS) network together with a new training strategy for ray exploration and exploitation, allowing for efficient fine-grained particle sampling. Our ProNeRF yields state-of-the-art metrics, being 15-23x faster with 0.65dB higher PSNR than NeRF and yielding 0.95dB higher PSNR than the best published sampler-based method, HyperReel. Our exploration and exploitation training strategy allows ProNeRF to learn the full scenes' color and density distributions while also learning efficient ray sampling focused on the highest-density regions. We provide extensive experimental results that support the effectiveness of our method on the widely adopted forward-facing and 360 datasets, LLFF and Blender, respectively. et.al.|[2312.08136](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08136)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**Neural Radiance Fields for Transparent Object Using Visual Hull**|Unlike opaque object, novel view synthesis of transparent object is a challenging task, because transparent object refracts light of background causing visual distortions on the transparent object surface along the viewpoint change. Recently introduced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a view synthesis method. Thanks to its remarkable performance improvement, lots of following applications based on NeRF in various topics have been developed. However, if an object with a different refractive index is included in a scene such as transparent object, NeRF shows limited performance because refracted light ray at the surface of the transparent object is not appropriately considered. To resolve the problem, we propose a NeRF-based method consisting of the following three steps: First, we reconstruct a three-dimensional shape of a transparent object using visual hull. Second, we simulate the refraction of the rays inside of the transparent object according to Snell's law. Last, we sample points through refracted rays and put them into NeRF. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our method addresses the limitation of conventional NeRF with transparent objects. et.al.|[2312.08118](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08118)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**uSF: Learning Neural Semantic Field with Uncertainty**|Recently, there has been an increased interest in NeRF methods which reconstruct differentiable representation of three-dimensional scenes. One of the main limitations of such methods is their inability to assess the confidence of the model in its predictions. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model for the formation of extended vector representations, called uSF, which allows the model to predict not only color and semantic label of each point, but also estimate the corresponding values of uncertainty. We show that with a small number of images available for training, a model quantifying uncertainty performs better than a model without such functionality. Code of the uSF approach is publicly available at https://github.com/sevashasla/usf/. et.al.|[2312.08012](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08012)|**[link](https://github.com/sevashasla/usf)**|
|**2023-12-12**|**COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting**|While neural rendering has led to impressive advances in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it relies heavily on accurately pre-computed camera poses. To relax this constraint, multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However, the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing. We process the input frames in a sequential manner and progressively grow the 3D Gaussians set by taking one input frame at a time, without the need to pre-compute the camera poses. Our method significantly improves over previous approaches in view synthesis and camera pose estimation under large motion changes.

|**2023-12-12**|**Unifying Correspondence, Pose and NeRF for Pose-Free Novel View Synthesis from Stereo Pairs**|This work delves into the task of pose-free novel view synthesis from stereo pairs, a challenging and pioneering task in 3D vision. Our innovative framework, unlike any before, seamlessly integrates 2D correspondence matching, camera pose estimation, and NeRF rendering, fostering a synergistic enhancement of these tasks. We achieve this through designing an architecture that utilizes a shared representation, which serves as a foundation for enhanced 3D geometry understanding. Capitalizing on the inherent interplay between the tasks, our unified framework is trained end-to-end with the proposed training strategy to improve overall model accuracy. Through extensive evaluations across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes from two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvement over previous methodologies, especially in scenarios characterized by extreme viewpoint changes and the absence of accurate camera poses. et.al.|[2312.07246](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07246)|**[link](https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/CoPoNeRF)**|
|**2023-12-12**|**WaterHE-NeRF: Water-ray Tracing Neural Radiance Fields for Underwater Scene Reconstruction**|Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) technology demonstrates immense potential in novel viewpoint synthesis tasks, due to its physics-based volumetric rendering process, which is particularly promising in underwater scenes. Addressing the limitations of existing underwater NeRF methods in handling light attenuation caused by the water medium and the lack of real Ground Truth (GT) supervision, this study proposes WaterHE-NeRF. We develop a new water-ray tracing field by Retinex theory that precisely encodes color, density, and illuminance attenuation in three-dimensional space. WaterHE-NeRF, through its illuminance attenuation mechanism, generates both degraded and clear multi-view images and optimizes image restoration by combining reconstruction loss with Wasserstein distance. Additionally, the use of histogram equalization (HE) as pseudo-GT enhances the network's accuracy in preserving original details and color distribution. Extensive experiments on real underwater datasets and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of WaterHE-NeRF. Our code will be made publicly available. et.al.|[2312.06946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06946)|null|
|**2023-12-10**|**TeTriRF: Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields for Efficient Free-Viewpoint Video**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) revolutionize the realm of visual media by providing photorealistic Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) experiences, offering viewers unparalleled immersion and interactivity. However, the technology's significant storage requirements and the computational complexity involved in generation and rendering currently limit its broader application. To close this gap, this paper presents Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields (TeTriRF), a novel technology that significantly reduces the storage size for Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) while maintaining low-cost generation and rendering. TeTriRF introduces a hybrid representation with tri-planes and voxel grids to support scaling up to long-duration sequences and scenes with complex motions or rapid changes. We propose a group training scheme tailored to achieving high training efficiency and yielding temporally consistent, low-entropy scene representations. Leveraging these properties of the representations, we introduce a compression pipeline with off-the-shelf video codecs, achieving an order of magnitude less storage size compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experiments demonstrate that TeTriRF can achieve competitive quality with a higher compression rate. et.al.|[2312.06713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06713)|null|
|**2023-12-11**|**CorresNeRF: Image Correspondence Priors for Neural Radiance Fields**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks. However, their performance suffers under challenging scenarios with sparse input views. We present CorresNeRF, a novel method that leverages image correspondence priors computed by off-the-shelf methods to supervise NeRF training. We design adaptive processes for augmentation and filtering to generate dense and high-quality correspondences. The correspondences are then used to regularize NeRF training via the correspondence pixel reprojection and depth loss terms. We evaluate our methods on novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction tasks with density-based and SDF-based NeRF models on different datasets. Our method outperforms previous methods in both photometric and geometric metrics. We show that this simple yet effective technique of using correspondence priors can be applied as a plug-and-play module across different NeRF variants.

|**2023-12-11**|**DreamControl: Control-Based Text-to-3D Generation with 3D Self-Prior**|3D generation has raised great attention in recent years. With the success of text-to-image diffusion models, the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation. However, these methods tend to present inconsistent geometry, which is also known as the Janus problem. We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects, i.e., viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it, we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework, namely DreamControl, which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically, adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries, in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures. DreamControl can generate high-quality 3D content in terms of both geometry consistency and texture fidelity. Moreover, our control-based optimization guidance is applicable to more downstream tasks, including user-guided generation and 3D animation.

|**2023-12-10**|**NeVRF: Neural Video-based Radiance Fields for Long-duration Sequences**|Adopting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to long-duration dynamic sequences has been challenging. Existing methods struggle to balance between quality and storage size and encounter difficulties with complex scene changes such as topological changes and large motions. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel neural video-based radiance fields (NeVRF) representation. NeVRF marries neural radiance field with image-based rendering to support photo-realistic novel view synthesis on long-duration dynamic inward-looking scenes. We introduce a novel multi-view radiance blending approach to predict radiance directly from multi-view videos. By incorporating continual learning techniques, NeVRF can efficiently reconstruct frames from sequential data without revisiting previous frames, enabling long-duration free-viewpoint video. Furthermore, with a tailored compression approach, NeVRF can compactly represent dynamic scenes, making dynamic radiance fields more practical in real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NeVRF in enabling long-duration sequence rendering, sequential data reconstruction, and compact data storage. et.al.|[2312.05855](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05855)|null|

|**2024-05-02**|**Multi-Space Alignments Towards Universal LiDAR Segmentation**|A unified and versatile LiDAR segmentation model with strong robustness and generalizability is desirable for safe autonomous driving perception. This work presents M3Net, a one-of-a-kind framework for fulfilling multi-task, multi-dataset, multi-modality LiDAR segmentation in a universal manner using just a single set of parameters. To better exploit data volume and diversity, we first combine large-scale driving datasets acquired by different types of sensors from diverse scenes and then conduct alignments in three spaces, namely data, feature, and label spaces, during the training. As a result, M3Net is capable of taming heterogeneous data for training state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation models. Extensive experiments on twelve LiDAR segmentation datasets verify our effectiveness. Notably, using a shared set of parameters, M3Net achieves 75.1%, 83.1%, and 72.4% mIoU scores, respectively, on the official benchmarks of SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open. et.al.|[2405.01538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01538)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**OmniDrive: A Holistic LLM-Agent Framework for Autonomous Driving with 3D Perception, Reasoning and Planning**|The advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to growing interests in LLM-based autonomous driving agents to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, capitalizing on MLLMs' strong reasoning capabilities for improved planning behavior is challenging since planning requires full 3D situational awareness beyond 2D reasoning. To address this challenge, our work proposes a holistic framework for strong alignment between agent models and 3D driving tasks. Our framework starts with a novel 3D MLLM architecture that uses sparse queries to lift and compress visual representations into 3D before feeding them into an LLM. This query-based representation allows us to jointly encode dynamic objects and static map elements (e.g., traffic lanes), providing a condensed world model for perception-action alignment in 3D. We further propose OmniDrive-nuScenes, a new visual question-answering dataset challenging the true 3D situational awareness of a model with comprehensive visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, including scene description, traffic regulation, 3D grounding, counterfactual reasoning, decision making and planning. Extensive studies show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture as well as the importance of the VQA tasks for reasoning and planning in complex 3D scenes. et.al.|[2405.01533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01533)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**An Advanced Framework for Ultra-Realistic Simulation and Digital Twinning for Autonomous Vehicles**|Simulation is a fundamental tool in developing autonomous vehicles, enabling rigorous testing without the logistical and safety challenges associated with real-world trials. As autonomous vehicle technologies evolve and public safety demands increase, advanced, realistic simulation frameworks are critical. Current testing paradigms employ a mix of general-purpose and specialized simulators, such as CARLA and IVRESS, to achieve high-fidelity results. However, these tools often struggle with compatibility due to differing platform, hardware, and software requirements, severely hampering their combined effectiveness. This paper introduces BlueICE, an advanced framework for ultra-realistic simulation and digital twinning, to address these challenges. BlueICE's innovative architecture allows for the decoupling of computing platforms, hardware, and software dependencies while offering researchers customizable testing environments to meet diverse fidelity needs. Key features include containerization to ensure compatibility across different systems, a unified communication bridge for seamless integration of various simulation tools, and synchronized orchestration of input and output across simulators. This framework facilitates the development of sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and sets a new standard in simulation accuracy and flexibility. The paper further explores the application of BlueICE in two distinct case studies: the ICAT indoor testbed and the STAR campus outdoor testbed at the University of Delaware. These case studies demonstrate BlueICE's capability to create sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and underline its potential as a standardized testbed for future autonomous driving technologies. et.al.|[2405.01328](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01328)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**MFTraj: Map-Free, Behavior-Driven Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving**|This paper introduces a trajectory prediction model tailored for autonomous driving, focusing on capturing complex interactions in dynamic traffic scenarios without reliance on high-definition maps. The model, termed MFTraj, harnesses historical trajectory data combined with a novel dynamic geometric graph-based behavior-aware module. At its core, an adaptive structure-aware interactive graph convolutional network captures both positional and behavioral features of road users, preserving spatial-temporal intricacies. Enhanced by a linear attention mechanism, the model achieves computational efficiency and reduced parameter overhead. Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models. The results and methodology suggest a significant advancement in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous systems. et.al.|[2405.01266](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01266)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**A Survey on Semantic Communication Networks: Architecture, Security, and Privacy**|Semantic communication, emerging as a breakthrough beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, aims to convey the essential meaning of source data rather than merely focusing on precise yet content-agnostic bit transmission. By interconnecting diverse intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles and VR devices) via semantic communications, the semantic communication networks (SemComNet) supports semantic-oriented transmission, efficient spectrum utilization, and flexible networking among collaborative agents. Consequently, SemComNet stands out for enabling ever-increasing intelligent applications, such as autonomous driving and Metaverse. However, being built on a variety of cutting-edge technologies including AI and knowledge graphs, SemComNet introduces diverse brand-new and unexpected threats, which pose obstacles to its widespread development. Besides, due to the intrinsic characteristics of SemComNet in terms of heterogeneous components, autonomous intelligence, and large-scale structure, a series of critical challenges emerge in securing SemComNet. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SemComNet from its fundamentals, security, and privacy aspects. Specifically, we first introduce a novel three-layer architecture of SemComNet for multi-agent interaction, which comprises the control layer, semantic transmission layer, and cognitive sensing layer. Then, we discuss its working modes and enabling technologies. Afterward, based on the layered architecture of SemComNet, we outline a taxonomy of security and privacy threats, while discussing state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we present future research directions, clarifying the path toward building intelligent, robust, and green SemComNet. To our knowledge, this survey is the first to comprehensively cover the fundamentals of SemComNet, alongside a detailed analysis of its security and privacy issues. et.al.|[2405.01221](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01221)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data Handling for Robust Vehicular Object Detection**|In the pursuit of refining precise perception models for fully autonomous driving, continual online model training becomes essential. Federated Learning (FL) within vehicular networks offers an efficient mechanism for model training while preserving raw sensory data integrity. Yet, FL struggles with non-identically distributed data (e.g., quantity skew), leading to suboptimal convergence rates during model training. In previous work, we introduced FedLA, an innovative Label-Aware aggregation method addressing data heterogeneity in FL for generic scenarios.   In this paper, we introduce FedProx+LA, a novel FL method building upon the state-of-the-art FedProx and FedLA to tackle data heterogeneity, which is specifically tailored for vehicular networks. We evaluate the efficacy of FedProx+LA in continuous online object detection model training. Through a comparative analysis against conventional and state-of-the-art methods, our findings reveal the superior convergence rate of FedProx+LA. Notably, if the label distribution is very heterogeneous, our FedProx+LA approach shows substantial improvements in detection performance compared to baseline methods, also outperforming our previous FedLA approach. Moreover, both FedLA and FedProx+LA increase convergence speed by 30% compared to baseline methods. et.al.|[2405.01108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01108)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Poisoning Attacks on Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving**|Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm, enabling parties to collaboratively train models while keeping their data confidential. Within autonomous driving, it brings the potential of reducing data storage costs, reducing bandwidth requirements, and to accelerate the learning. FL is, however, susceptible to poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce two novel poisoning attacks on FL tailored to regression tasks within autonomous driving: FLStealth and Off-Track Attack (OTA). FLStealth, an untargeted attack, aims at providing model updates that deteriorate the global model performance while appearing benign. OTA, on the other hand, is a targeted attack with the objective to change the global model's behavior when exposed to a certain trigger. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by conducting comprehensive experiments pertaining to the task of vehicle trajectory prediction. In particular, we show that, among five different untargeted attacks, FLStealth is the most successful at bypassing the considered defenses employed by the server. For OTA, we demonstrate the inability of common defense strategies to mitigate the attack, highlighting the critical need for new defensive mechanisms against targeted attacks within FL for autonomous driving. et.al.|[2405.01073](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01073)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**A Roadmap for Simulation-Based Testing of Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems: Challenges and Future Direction**|As the era of autonomous cyber-physical systems (ACPSs), such as unmanned aerial vehicles and self-driving cars, unfolds, the demand for robust testing methodologies is key to realizing the adoption of such systems in real-world scenarios. However, traditional software testing paradigms face unprecedented challenges in ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems. In response, this paper pioneers a strategic roadmap for simulation-based testing of ACPSs, specifically focusing on autonomous systems. Our paper discusses the relevant challenges and obstacles of ACPSs, focusing on test automation and quality assurance, hence advocating for tailored solutions to address the unique demands of autonomous systems. While providing concrete definitions of test cases within simulation environments, we also accentuate the need to create new benchmark assets and the development of automated tools tailored explicitly for autonomous systems in the software engineering community. This paper not only highlights the relevant, pressing issues the software engineering community should focus on (in terms of practices, expected automation, and paradigms), but it also outlines ways to tackle them. By outlining the various domains and challenges of simulation-based testing/development for ACPSs, we provide directions for future research efforts. et.al.|[2405.01064](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01064)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Addressing Diverging Training Costs using Local Restoration for Precise Bird's Eye View Map Construction**|Recent advancements in Bird's Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky self-driving, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel Trumpet Neural Network (TNN) mechanism. The framework utilizes LR BEV space and outputs an up-sampled semantic BEV map to create a memory-efficient pipeline. To this end, we introduce Local Restoration of BEV representation. Specifically, the up-sampled BEV representation has severely aliased, blocky signals, and thick semantic labels. Our proposed Local Restoration restores the signals and thins (or narrows down) the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the TNN mechanism provides a plug-and-play memory-efficient pipeline, thereby enabling the effective estimation of real-sized (or precise) semantic labels for BEV map construction. et.al.|[2405.01016](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01016)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Rare Collision Risk Estimation of Autonomous Vehicles with Multi-Agent Situation Awareness**|This paper offers a formal framework for the rare collision risk estimation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with multi-agent situation awareness, affected by different sources of noise in a complex dynamic environment. In our proposed setting, the situation awareness is considered for one of the ego vehicles by aggregating a range of diverse information gathered from other vehicles into a vector. We model AVs equipped with the situation awareness as general stochastic hybrid systems (GSHS) and assess the probability of collision in a lane-change scenario where two self-driving vehicles simultaneously intend to switch lanes into a shared one, while utilizing the time-to-collision measure for decision-making as required. Due to the substantial data requirements of simulation-based methods for the rare collision risk estimation, we leverage a multi-level importance splitting technique, known as interacting particle system-based estimation with fixed assignment splitting (IPS-FAS). This approach allows us to estimate the probability of a rare event by employing a group of interacting particles. Specifically, each particle embodies a system trajectory and engages with others through resampling and branching, focusing computational resources on trajectories with the highest probability of encountering the rare event. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through an extensive simulation of a lane-change scenario. et.al.|[2405.01011](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01011)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Lane Segmentation Refinement with Diffusion Models**|The lane graph is a key component for building high-definition (HD) maps and crucial for downstream tasks such as autonomous driving or navigation planning. Previously, He et al. (2022) explored the extraction of the lane-level graph from aerial imagery utilizing a segmentation based approach. However, segmentation networks struggle to achieve perfect segmentation masks resulting in inaccurate lane graph extraction. We explore additional enhancements to refine this segmentation-based approach and extend it with a diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) component. This combination further improves the GEO F1 and TOPO F1 scores, which are crucial indicators of the quality of a lane graph, in the undirected graph in non-intersection areas. We conduct experiments on a publicly available dataset, demonstrating that our method outperforms the previous approach, particularly in enhancing the connectivity of such a graph, as measured by the TOPO F1 score. Moreover, we perform ablation studies on the individual components of our method to understand their contribution and evaluate their effectiveness. et.al.|[2405.00620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00620)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**GAD-Generative Learning for HD Map-Free Autonomous Driving**|Deep-learning-based techniques have been widely adopted for autonomous driving software stacks for mass production in recent years, focusing primarily on perception modules, with some work extending this method to prediction modules. However, the downstream planning and control modules are still designed with hefty handcrafted rules, dominated by optimization-based methods such as quadratic programming or model predictive control. This results in a performance bottleneck for autonomous driving systems in that corner cases simply cannot be solved by enumerating hand-crafted rules. We present a deep-learning-based approach that brings prediction, decision, and planning modules together with the attempt to overcome the rule-based methods' deficiency in real-world applications of autonomous driving, especially for urban scenes. The DNN model we proposed is solely trained with 10 hours of human driver data, and it supports all mass-production ADAS features available on the market to date. This method is deployed onto a Jiyue test car with no modification to its factory-ready sensor set and compute platform. the feasibility, usability, and commercial potential are demonstrated in this article. et.al.|[2405.00515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00515)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**On the Relevance of Byzantine Robust Optimization Against Data Poisoning**|The success of machine learning (ML) has been intimately linked with the availability of large amounts of data, typically collected from heterogeneous sources and processed on vast networks of computing devices (also called {\em workers}). Beyond accuracy, the use of ML in critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving calls for robustness against {\em data poisoning}and some {\em faulty workers}. The problem of {\em Byzantine ML} formalizes these robustness issues by considering a distributed ML environment in which workers (storing a portion of the global dataset) can deviate arbitrarily from the prescribed algorithm. Although the problem has attracted a lot of attention from a theoretical point of view, its practical importance for addressing realistic faults (where the behavior of any worker is locally constrained) remains unclear. It has been argued that the seemingly weaker threat model where only workers' local datasets get poisoned is more reasonable. We prove that, while tolerating a wider range of faulty behaviors, Byzantine ML yields solutions that are, in a precise sense, optimal even under the weaker data poisoning threat model. Then, we study a generic data poisoning model wherein some workers have {\em fully-poisonous local data}, i.e., their datasets are entirely corruptible, and the remainders have {\em partially-poisonous local data}, i.e., only a fraction of their local datasets is corruptible. We prove that Byzantine-robust schemes yield optimal solutions against both these forms of data poisoning, and that the former is more harmful when workers have {\em heterogeneous} local data. et.al.|[2405.00491](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00491)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**RAG-based Explainable Prediction of Road Users Behaviors for Automated Driving using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models**|Prediction of road users' behaviors in the context of autonomous driving has gained considerable attention by the scientific community in the last years. Most works focus on predicting behaviors based on kinematic information alone, a simplification of the reality since road users are humans, and as such they are highly influenced by their surrounding context. In addition, a large plethora of research works rely on powerful Deep Learning techniques, which exhibit high performance metrics in prediction tasks but may lack the ability to fully understand and exploit the contextual semantic information contained in the road scene, not to mention their inability to provide explainable predictions that can be understood by humans. In this work, we propose an explainable road users' behavior prediction system that integrates the reasoning abilities of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and the expressiveness capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. For that purpose, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Bayesian inference are combined to allow the deployment of a fully inductive reasoning system that enables the issuing of predictions that rely on legacy information contained in the graph as well as on current evidence gathered in real time by onboard sensors. Two use cases have been implemented following the proposed approach: 1) Prediction of pedestrians' crossing actions; 2) Prediction of lane change maneuvers. In both cases, the performance attained surpasses the current state of the art in terms of anticipation and F1-score, showing a promising avenue for future research in this field. et.al.|[2405.00449](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00449)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Dual-Role AoI-based Incentive Mechanism for HD map Crowdsourcing**|A high-quality fresh high-definition (HD) map is vital in enhancing transportation efficiency and safety in autonomous driving. Vehicle-based crowdsourcing offers a promising approach for updating HD maps. However, recruiting crowdsourcing vehicles involves making the challenging tradeoff between the HD map freshness and recruitment costs. Existing studies on HD map crowdsourcing often (1) prioritize maximizing spatial coverage and (2) overlook the dual role of crowdsourcing vehicles in HD maps, as vehicles serve both as contributors and customers of HD maps. This motivates us to propose the Dual-Role Age of Information (AoI) based Incentive Mechanism (DRAIM) to address these issues. % Specifically, we propose the trajectory age of information, incorporating the expected AoI of the HD map and the trajectory, to quantify a vehicle's HD map usage utility, which is freshness- and trajectory-dependent. DRAIM aims to achieve the company's tradeoff between freshness and recruitment costs. et.al.|[2405.00353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00353)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Enhance Planning with Physics-informed Safety Controllor for End-to-end Autonomous Driving**|Recent years have seen a growing research interest in applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on autonomous vehicle technology. The trend started with perception and prediction a few years ago and it is gradually being applied to motion planning tasks. Despite the performance of networks improve over time, DNN planners inherit the natural drawbacks of Deep Learning. Learning-based planners have limitations in achieving perfect accuracy on the training dataset and network performance can be affected by out-of-distribution problem. In this paper, we propose FusionAssurance, a novel trajectory-based end-to-end driving fusion framework which combines physics-informed control for safety assurance. By incorporating Potential Field into Model Predictive Control, FusionAssurance is capable of navigating through scenarios that are not included in the training dataset and scenarios where neural network fail to generalize. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments under various scenarios on the CARLA benchmark. et.al.|[2405.00316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00316)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**SemVecNet: Generalizable Vector Map Generation for Arbitrary Sensor Configurations**|Vector maps are essential in autonomous driving for tasks like localization and planning, yet their creation and maintenance are notably costly. While recent advances in online vector map generation for autonomous vehicles are promising, current models lack adaptability to different sensor configurations. They tend to overfit to specific sensor poses, leading to decreased performance and higher retraining costs. This limitation hampers their practical use in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, we propose a modular pipeline for vector map generation with improved generalization to sensor configurations. The pipeline leverages probabilistic semantic mapping to generate a bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic map as an intermediate representation. This intermediate representation is then converted to a vector map using the MapTRv2 decoder. By adopting a BEV semantic map robust to different sensor configurations, our proposed approach significantly improves the generalization performance. We evaluate the model on datasets with sensor configurations not used during training. Our evaluation sets includes larger public datasets, and smaller scale private data collected on our platform. Our model generalizes significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2405.00250](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00250)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Guiding Attention in End-to-End Driving Models**|Vision-based end-to-end driving models trained by imitation learning can lead to affordable solutions for autonomous driving. However, training these well-performing models usually requires a huge amount of data, while still lacking explicit and intuitive activation maps to reveal the inner workings of these models while driving. In this paper, we study how to guide the attention of these models to improve their driving quality and obtain more intuitive activation maps by adding a loss term during training using salient semantic maps. In contrast to previous work, our method does not require these salient semantic maps to be available during testing time, as well as removing the need to modify the model's architecture to which it is applied. We perform tests using perfect and noisy salient semantic maps with encouraging results in both, the latter of which is inspired by possible errors encountered with real data. Using CIL++ as a representative state-of-the-art model and the CARLA simulator with its standard benchmarks, we conduct experiments that show the effectiveness of our method in training better autonomous driving models, especially when data and computational resources are scarce. et.al.|[2405.00242](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00242)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**STT: Stateful Tracking with Transformers for Autonomous Driving**|Tracking objects in three-dimensional space is critical for autonomous driving. To ensure safety while driving, the tracker must be able to reliably track objects across frames and accurately estimate their states such as velocity and acceleration in the present. Existing works frequently focus on the association task while either neglecting the model performance on state estimation or deploying complex heuristics to predict the states. In this paper, we propose STT, a Stateful Tracking model built with Transformers, that can consistently track objects in the scenes while also predicting their states accurately. STT consumes rich appearance, geometry, and motion signals through long term history of detections and is jointly optimized for both data association and state estimation tasks. Since the standard tracking metrics like MOTA and MOTP do not capture the combined performance of the two tasks in the wider spectrum of object states, we extend them with new metrics called S-MOTA and MOTPS that address this limitation. STT achieves competitive real-time performance on the Waymo Open Dataset. et.al.|[2405.00236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00236)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**A decomposition-based approach for large-scale pickup and delivery problems**|With the advent of self-driving cars, experts envision autonomous mobility-on-demand services in the near future to cope with overloaded transportation systems in cities worldwide. Efficient operations are imperative to unlock such a system's maximum improvement potential. Existing approaches either consider a narrow planning horizon or ignore essential characteristics of the underlying problem. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework that allows the study of very large-scale pickup and delivery routing problems with more than 20 thousand requests, which arise in the context of integrated request pooling and vehicle-to-request dispatching. We conduct a computational study and present comparative results showing the characteristics of the developed approaches. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to related benchmark instances from the literature to show the efficacy. Finally, we solve very large-scale instances and derive insights on upper-bound improvements regarding fleet sizing and customer delay acceptance from a practical perspective. et.al.|[2405.00230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00230)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Pseudo Label Refinery for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Cross-dataset 3D Object Detection**|Recent self-training techniques have shown notable improvements in unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection (3D UDA). These techniques typically select pseudo labels, i.e., 3D boxes, to supervise models for the target domain. However, this selection process inevitably introduces unreliable 3D boxes, in which 3D points cannot be definitively assigned as foreground or background. Previous techniques mitigate this by reweighting these boxes as pseudo labels, but these boxes can still poison the training process. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo label refinery framework. Specifically, in the selection process, to improve the reliability of pseudo boxes, we propose a complementary augmentation strategy. This strategy involves either removing all points within an unreliable box or replacing it with a high-confidence box. Moreover, the point numbers of instances in high-beam datasets are considerably higher than those in low-beam datasets, also degrading the quality of pseudo labels during the training process. We alleviate this issue by generating additional proposals and aligning RoI features across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the quality of pseudo labels and consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on six autonomous driving benchmarks.

|**2024-04-30**|**SemanticFormer: Holistic and Semantic Traffic Scene Representation for Trajectory Prediction using Knowledge Graphs**|Trajectory prediction in autonomous driving relies on accurate representation of all relevant contexts of the driving scene including traffic participants, road topology, traffic signs as well as their semantic relations to each other. Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2404.19379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19379)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction**|Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/G2LTraj. et.al.|[2404.19330](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330)|**[link](https://github.com/zhanwei-z/g2ltraj)**|
|**2024-04-30**|**Robust Pedestrian Detection via Constructing Versatile Pedestrian Knowledge Bank**|Pedestrian detection is a crucial field of computer vision research which can be adopted in various real-world applications (e.g., self-driving systems). However, despite noticeable evolution of pedestrian detection, pedestrian representations learned within a detection framework are usually limited to particular scene data in which they were trained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct versatile pedestrian knowledge bank containing representative pedestrian knowledge which can be applicable to various detection frameworks and adopted in diverse scenes. We extract generalized pedestrian knowledge from a large-scale pretrained model, and we curate them by quantizing most representative features and guiding them to be distinguishable from background scenes. Finally, we construct versatile pedestrian knowledge bank which is composed of such representations, and then we leverage it to complement and enhance pedestrian features within a pedestrian detection framework. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating its versatility and outperforming state-of-the-art detection performances. et.al.|[2404.19299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19299)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**PlanNetX: Learning an Efficient Neural Network Planner from MPC for Longitudinal Control**|Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful, optimization-based approach for controlling dynamical systems. However, the computational complexity of online optimization can be problematic on embedded devices. Especially, when we need to guarantee fixed control frequencies. Thus, previous work proposed to reduce the computational burden using imitation learning (IL) approximating the MPC policy by a neural network. In this work, we instead learn the whole planned trajectory of the MPC. We introduce a combination of a novel neural network architecture PlanNetX and a simple loss function based on the state trajectory that leverages the parameterized optimal control structure of the MPC. We validate our approach in the context of autonomous driving by learning a longitudinal planner and benchmarking it extensively in the CommonRoad simulator using synthetic scenarios and scenarios derived from real data. Our experimental results show that we can learn the open-loop MPC trajectory with high accuracy while improving the closed-loop performance of the learned control policy over other baselines like behavior cloning. et.al.|[2404.18863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18863)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Safe Reach Set Computation via Neural Barrier Certificates**|We present a novel technique for online safety verification of autonomous systems, which performs reachability analysis efficiently for both bounded and unbounded horizons by employing neural barrier certificates. Our approach uses barrier certificates given by parameterized neural networks that depend on a given initial set, unsafe sets, and time horizon. Such networks are trained efficiently offline using system simulations sampled from regions of the state space. We then employ a meta-neural network to generalize the barrier certificates to state space regions that are outside the training set. These certificates are generated and validated online as sound over-approximations of the reachable states, thus either ensuring system safety or activating appropriate alternative actions in unsafe scenarios. We demonstrate our technique on case studies from linear models to nonlinear control-dependent models for online autonomous driving scenarios. et.al.|[2404.18813](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18813)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Uncertainty-boosted Robust Video Activity Anticipation**|Video activity anticipation aims to predict what will happen in the future, embracing a broad application prospect ranging from robot vision and autonomous driving. Despite the recent progress, the data uncertainty issue, reflected as the content evolution process and dynamic correlation in event labels, has been somehow ignored. This reduces the model generalization ability and deep understanding on video content, leading to serious error accumulation and degraded performance. In this paper, we address the uncertainty learning problem and propose an uncertainty-boosted robust video activity anticipation framework, which generates uncertainty values to indicate the credibility of the anticipation results. The uncertainty value is used to derive a temperature parameter in the softmax function to modulate the predicted target activity distribution. To guarantee the distribution adjustment, we construct a reasonable target activity label representation by incorporating the activity evolution from the temporal class correlation and the semantic relationship. Moreover, we quantify the uncertainty into relative values by comparing the uncertainty among sample pairs and their temporal-lengths. This relative strategy provides a more accessible way in uncertainty modeling than quantifying the absolute uncertainty values on the whole dataset. Experiments on multiple backbones and benchmarks show our framework achieves promising performance and better robustness/interpretability.

|**2024-04-29**|**Assessing Quality Metrics for Neural Reality Gap Input Mitigation in Autonomous Driving Testing**|Simulation-based testing of automated driving systems (ADS) is the industry standard, being a controlled, safe, and cost-effective alternative to real-world testing. Despite these advantages, virtual simulations often fail to accurately replicate real-world conditions like image fidelity, texture representation, and environmental accuracy. This can lead to significant differences in ADS behavior between simulated and real-world domains, a phenomenon known as the sim2real gap. Researchers have used Image-to-Image (I2I) neural translation to mitigate the sim2real gap, enhancing the realism of simulated environments by transforming synthetic data into more authentic representations of real-world conditions. However, while promising, these techniques may potentially introduce artifacts, distortions, or inconsistencies in the generated data that can affect the effectiveness of ADS testing. In our empirical study, we investigated how the quality of image-to-image (I2I) techniques influences the mitigation of the sim2real gap, using a set of established metrics from the literature. We evaluated two popular generative I2I architectures, pix2pix, and CycleGAN, across two ADS perception tasks at a model level, namely vehicle detection and end-to-end lane keeping, using paired simulated and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of I2I architectures varies across different ADS tasks, and existing evaluation metrics do not consistently align with the ADS behavior. Thus, we conducted task-specific fine-tuning of perception metrics, which yielded a stronger correlation. Our findings indicate that a perception metric that incorporates semantic elements, tailored to each task, can facilitate selecting the most appropriate I2I technique for a reliable assessment of the sim2real gap mitigation. et.al.|[2404.18577](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18577)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Predicting Safety Misbehaviours in Autonomous Driving Systems using Uncertainty Quantification**|The automated real-time recognition of unexpected situations plays a crucial role in the safety of autonomous vehicles, especially in unsupported and unpredictable scenarios. This paper evaluates different Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods from the deep learning domain for the anticipatory testing of safety-critical misbehaviours during system-level simulation-based testing. Specifically, we compute uncertainty scores as the vehicle executes, following the intuition that high uncertainty scores are indicative of unsupported runtime conditions that can be used to distinguish safe from failure-inducing driving behaviors. In our study, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and computational overhead associated with two Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods, namely MC- Dropout and Deep Ensembles, for misbehaviour avoidance. Overall, for three benchmarks from the Udacity simulator comprising both out-of-distribution and unsafe conditions introduced via mutation testing, both methods successfully detected a high number of out-of-bounds episodes providing early warnings several seconds in advance, outperforming two state-of-the-art misbehaviour prediction methods based on autoencoders and attention maps in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, Deep Ensembles detected most misbehaviours without any false alarms and did so even when employing a relatively small number of models, making them computationally feasible for real-time detection. Our findings suggest that incorporating uncertainty quantification methods is a viable approach for building fail-safe mechanisms in deep neural network-based autonomous vehicles. et.al.|[2404.18573](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18573)|**[link](https://github.com/ast-fortiss-tum/misbehaviour-prediction-with-uncertainty-quantification)**|
|**2024-04-29**|**MRIC: Model-Based Reinforcement-Imitation Learning with Mixture-of-Codebooks for Autonomous Driving Simulation**|Accurately simulating diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents in various scenarios is fundamental to autonomous driving simulation. This task is challenging due to the multi-modality of behavior distribution, the high-dimensionality of driving scenarios, distribution shift, and incomplete information. Our first insight is to leverage state-matching through differentiable simulation to provide meaningful learning signals and achieve efficient credit assignment for the policy. This is demonstrated by revealing the existence of gradient highways and interagent gradient pathways. However, the issues of gradient explosion and weak supervision in low-density regions are discovered. Our second insight is that these issues can be addressed by applying dual policy regularizations to narrow the function space. Further considering diversity, our third insight is that the behaviors of heterogeneous agents in the dataset can be effectively compressed as a series of prototype vectors for retrieval. These lead to our model-based reinforcement-imitation learning framework with temporally abstracted mixture-of-codebooks (MRIC). MRIC introduces the open-loop modelbased imitation learning regularization to stabilize training, and modelbased reinforcement learning (RL) regularization to inject domain knowledge. The RL regularization involves differentiable Minkowskidifference-based collision avoidance and projection-based on-road and traffic rule compliance rewards. A dynamic multiplier mechanism is further proposed to eliminate the interference from the regularizations while ensuring their effectiveness. Experimental results using the largescale Waymo open motion dataset show that MRIC outperforms state-ofthe-art baselines on diversity, behavioral realism, and distributional realism, with large margins on some key metrics (e.g., collision rate, minSADE, and time-to-collision JSD). et.al.|[2404.18464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18464)|null|

To address this challenge, we present RadSimReal, an innovative physical radar simulation capable of generating synthetic radar images with accompanying annotations for various radar types and environmental conditions, all without the need for real data collection. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate that training object detection models on RadSimReal data and subsequently evaluating them on real-world data produce performance levels comparable to models trained and tested on real data from the same dataset, and even achieves better performance when testing across different real datasets. RadSimReal offers advantages over other physical radar simulations that it does not necessitate knowledge of the radar design details, which are often not disclosed by radar suppliers, and has faster run-time.

|**2024-04-27**|**BoostRad: Enhancing Object Detection by Boosting Radar Reflections**|Automotive radars have an important role in autonomous driving systems. The main challenge in automotive radar detection is the radar's wide point spread function (PSF) in the angular domain that causes blurriness and clutter in the radar image. Numerous studies suggest employing an 'end-to-end' learning strategy using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to directly detect objects from radar images. This approach implicitly addresses the PSF's impact on objects of interest. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which we term "Boosting Radar Reflections" (BoostRad). In BoostRad, a first DNN is trained to narrow the PSF for all the reflection points in the scene. The output of the first DNN is a boosted reflection image with higher resolution and reduced clutter, resulting in a sharper and cleaner image. Subsequently, a second DNN is employed to detect objects within the boosted reflection image. We develop a novel method for training the boosting DNN that incorporates domain knowledge of radar's PSF characteristics. BoostRad's performance is evaluated using the RADDet and CARRADA datasets, revealing its superiority over reference methods. et.al.|[2404.17861](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17861)|null|
|**2024-04-27**|**Motion planning for off-road autonomous driving based on human-like cognition and weight adaptation**|Driving in an off-road environment is challenging for autonomous vehicles due to the complex and varied terrain. To ensure stable and efficient travel, the vehicle requires consideration and balancing of environmental factors, such as undulations, roughness, and obstacles, to generate optimal trajectories that can adapt to changing scenarios. However, traditional motion planners often utilize a fixed cost function for trajectory optimization, making it difficult to adapt to different driving strategies in challenging irregular terrains and uncommon scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive motion planner based on human-like cognition and cost evaluation for off-road driving. First, we construct a multi-layer map describing different features of off-road terrains, including terrain elevation, roughness, obstacle, and artificial potential field map. Subsequently, we employ a CNN-LSTM network to learn the trajectories planned by human drivers in various off-road scenarios. Then, based on human-like generated trajectories in different environments, we design a primitive-based trajectory planner that aims to mimic human trajectories and cost weight selection, generating trajectories that are consistent with the dynamics of off-road vehicles. Finally, we compute optimal cost weights and select and extend behavioral primitives to generate highly adaptive, stable, and efficient trajectories.   We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments in a desert off-road environment with complex terrain and varying road conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed human-like motion planner has excellent adaptability to different off-road conditions. It shows real-time operation, greater stability, and more human-like planning ability in diverse and challenging scenarios. et.al.|[2404.17820](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17820)|null|

|**2024-04-26**|**Cost-Sensitive Uncertainty-Based Failure Recognition for Object Detection**|Object detectors in real-world applications often fail to detect objects due to varying factors such as weather conditions and noisy input. Therefore, a process that mitigates false detections is crucial for both safety and accuracy. While uncertainty-based thresholding shows promise, previous works demonstrate an imperfect correlation between uncertainty and detection errors. This hinders ideal thresholding, prompting us to further investigate the correlation and associated cost with different types of uncertainty. We therefore propose a cost-sensitive framework for object detection tailored to user-defined budgets on the two types of errors, missing and false detections. We derive minimum thresholding requirements to prevent performance degradation and define metrics to assess the applicability of uncertainty for failure recognition. Furthermore, we automate and optimize the thresholding process to maximize the failure recognition rate w.r.t. the specified budget. Evaluation on three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances safety, particularly in challenging scenarios. Leveraging localization aleatoric uncertainty and softmax-based entropy only, our method boosts the failure recognition rate by 36-60\% compared to conventional approaches.

However, neural networks used in AD systems are generally considered black boxes. As a countermeasure, we have methods of explainable AI (XAI), such as feature relevance estimation and dimensionality reduction. Coarse graining techniques can also help reduce dimensionality and find interpretable global patterns. A specific coarse graining method is Renormalization Groups from statistical physics. It has previously been applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to interpret unsupervised learning. We refine this technique by building a transparent backbone model for convolutional variational autoencoders (VAE) that allows mapping latent values to input features and has performance comparable to trained black box VAEs. Moreover, we propose a custom feature map visualization technique to analyze the internal convolutional layers in the VAE to explain internal causes of poor reconstruction that may lead to dangerous traffic scenarios in AD applications. In a second key contribution, we propose explanation and evaluation techniques for the internal dynamics and feature relevance of prediction networks. We test a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in the computer vision domain to evaluate the predictability and in future applications potentially safety of prediction models.

However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining.

|**2024-04-26**|**Beyond Imitation: A Life-long Policy Learning Framework for Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Driving**|Model-free learning-based control methods have recently shown significant advantages over traditional control methods in avoiding complex vehicle characteristic estimation and parameter tuning. As a primary policy learning method, imitation learning (IL) is capable of learning control policies directly from expert demonstrations. However, the performance of IL policies is highly dependent on the data sufficiency and quality of the demonstrations. To alleviate the above problems of IL-based policies, a lifelong policy learning (LLPL) framework is proposed in this paper, which extends the IL scheme with lifelong learning (LLL). First, a novel IL-based model-free control policy learning method for path tracking is introduced. Even with imperfect demonstration, the optimal control policy can be learned directly from historical driving data. Second, by using the LLL method, the pre-trained IL policy can be safely updated and fine-tuned with incremental execution knowledge. Third, a knowledge evaluation method for policy learning is introduced to avoid learning redundant or inferior knowledge, thus ensuring the performance improvement of online policy learning. Experiments are conducted using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic model in various scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed LLPL framework can continuously improve the policy performance with collected incremental driving data, and achieves the best accuracy and control smoothness compared to other baseline methods after evolving on a 7 km curved road. Through learning and evaluation with noisy real-life data collected in an off-road environment, the proposed LLPL framework also demonstrates its applicability in learning and evolving in real-life scenarios. et.al.|[2404.17198](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17198)|null|

Traditional self-driving technologies, while advanced, typically do not translate directly to pedestrian applications due to their reliance on extensive sensor arrays and non-feasible computational frameworks. This highlights a significant gap in applying these solutions to human users since human navigation introduces unique challenges, including the unpredictable nature of human movement, limited processing capabilities of portable devices, and the need for directional responsiveness due to the limited perception range of humans. In this project, we introduce an image-only method that applies motion analysis using optical flow with ego-motion compensation to predict Motor Focus-where and how humans or machines focus their movement intentions. Meanwhile, this paper addresses the camera shaking issue in handheld and body-mounted devices which can severely degrade performance and accuracy, by applying a Gaussian aggregation to stabilize the predicted motor focus area and enhance the prediction accuracy of movement direction. This also provides a robust, real-time solution that adapts to the user's immediate environment. Furthermore, in the experiments part, we show the qualitative analysis of motor focus estimation between the conventional dense optical flow-based method and the proposed method. In quantitative tests, we show the performance of the proposed method on a collected small dataset that is specialized for motor focus estimation tasks. et.al.|[2404.17031](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17031)|null|

Traditional CF models, though simple, often lack generalization capabilities, while many data-driven methods, despite their robustness, operate as "black boxes" with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a Bayesian Matrix Normal Mixture Regression (MNMR) model that simultaneously captures feature correlations and temporal dynamics inherent in CF behaviors. This approach is distinguished by its separate learning of row and column covariance matrices within the model framework, offering an insightful perspective into the human driver decision-making processes. Through extensive experiments, we assess the model's performance across various historical steps of inputs, predictive steps of outputs, and model complexities. The results consistently demonstrate our model's adeptness in effectively capturing the intricate correlations and temporal dynamics present during CF. A focused case study further illustrates the model's outperforming interpretability of identifying distinct operational conditions through the learned mean and covariance matrices. This not only underlines our model's effectiveness in understanding complex human driving behaviors in CF scenarios but also highlights its potential as a tool for enhancing the interpretability of CF behaviors in traffic simulations and autonomous driving systems. et.al.|[2404.16023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16023)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**OccGen: Generative Multi-modal 3D Occupancy Prediction for Autonomous Driving**|Existing solutions for 3D semantic occupancy prediction typically treat the task as a one-shot 3D voxel-wise segmentation perception problem. These discriminative methods focus on learning the mapping between the inputs and occupancy map in a single step, lacking the ability to gradually refine the occupancy map and the reasonable scene imaginative capacity to complete the local regions somewhere. In this paper, we introduce OccGen, a simple yet powerful generative perception model for the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction. OccGen adopts a ''noise-to-occupancy'' generative paradigm, progressively inferring and refining the occupancy map by predicting and eliminating noise originating from a random Gaussian distribution. OccGen consists of two main components: a conditional encoder that is capable of processing multi-modal inputs, and a progressive refinement decoder that applies diffusion denoising using the multi-modal features as conditions. A key insight of this generative pipeline is that the diffusion denoising process is naturally able to model the coarse-to-fine refinement of the dense 3D occupancy map, therefore producing more detailed predictions. Extensive experiments on several occupancy benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. For instance, OccGen relatively enhances the mIoU by 9.5%, 6.3%, and 13.3% on nuScenes-Occupancy dataset under the muli-modal, LiDAR-only, and camera-only settings, respectively. Moreover, as a generative perception model, OccGen exhibits desirable properties that discriminative models cannot achieve, such as providing uncertainty estimates alongside its multiple-step predictions. et.al.|[2404.15014](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15014)|null|

As automation levels escalate, the demand rises for enhanced accuracy, reliability, energy efficiency, update rate, and reduced latency in position information delivery. In this paper, we propose the exploitation of backscattering from retro-directive antenna arrays (RAAs) to address these imperatives. We introduce and discuss two RAA-based architectures designed for various applications, including network localization and navigation. These architectures enable swift and simple angle-of-arrival estimation by using signals backscattered from RAAs. They also leverage multiple antennas to capitalize on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains, thereby addressing the challenges posed by the inherent path loss in backscatter communication, especially when operating at high frequencies. Consequently, angle-based localization becomes achievable with remarkably low latency, ideal for mobile and vehicular applications. This paper introduces ad-hoc signalling and processing schemes for this purpose, and their performance is analytically investigated. Numerical results underscore the potential of these schemes, offering precise and ultra-low-latency localization with low complexity and ultra-low energy consumption devices. et.al.|[2404.14206](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14206)|null|
|**2024-04-22**|**PointDifformer: Robust Point Cloud Registration With Neural Diffusion and Transformer**|Point cloud registration is a fundamental technique in 3-D computer vision with applications in graphics, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, registration tasks under challenging conditions, under which noise or perturbations are prevalent, can be difficult. We propose a robust point cloud registration approach that leverages graph neural partial differential equations (PDEs) and heat kernel signatures. Our method first uses graph neural PDE modules to extract high dimensional features from point clouds by aggregating information from the 3-D point neighborhood, thereby enhancing the robustness of the feature representations. Then, we incorporate heat kernel signatures into an attention mechanism to efficiently obtain corresponding keypoints. Finally, a singular value decomposition (SVD) module with learnable weights is used to predict the transformation between two point clouds. Empirical experiments on a 3-D point cloud dataset demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance for point cloud registration but also exhibits better robustness to additive noise or 3-D shape perturbations. et.al.|[2404.14034](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14034)|null|

|**2024-04-22**|**Benchmarking Multi-Modal LLMs for Testing Visual Deep Learning Systems Through the Lens of Image Mutation**|Visual deep learning (VDL) systems have shown significant success in real-world applications like image recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving. To evaluate the reliability of VDL, a mainstream approach is software testing, which requires diverse and controllable mutations over image semantics. The rapid development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has introduced revolutionary image mutation potentials through instruction-driven methods. Users can now freely describe desired mutations and let MLLMs generate the mutated images.   However, the quality of MLLM-produced test inputs in VDL testing remains largely unexplored. We present the first study, aiming to assess MLLMs' adequacy from 1) the semantic validity of MLLM mutated images, 2) the alignment of MLLM mutated images with their text instructions (prompts), 3) the faithfulness of how different mutations preserve semantics that are ought to remain unchanged, and 4) the effectiveness of detecting VDL faults. With large-scale human studies and quantitative evaluations, we identify MLLM's promising potentials in expanding the covered semantics of image mutations. Notably, while SoTA MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) fail to support or perform worse in editing existing semantics in images (as in traditional mutations like rotation), they generate high-quality test inputs using "semantic-additive" mutations (e.g., "dress a dog with clothes"), which bring extra semantics to images; these were infeasible for past approaches. Hence, we view MLLM-based mutations as a vital complement to traditional mutations, and advocate future VDL testing tasks to combine MLLM-based methods and traditional image mutations for comprehensive and reliable testing. et.al.|[2404.13945](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13945)|null|

To explore the potential of infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving, this paper presents the design and deployment of Soar, the first end-to-end SRI system specifically designed to support autonomous driving systems. Soar consists of both software and hardware components carefully designed to overcome various system and physical challenges. Soar can leverage the existing operational infrastructure like street lampposts for a lower barrier of adoption. Soar adopts a new communication architecture that comprises a bi-directional multi-hop I2I network and a downlink I2V broadcast service, which are designed based on off-the-shelf 802.11ac interfaces in an integrated manner. Soar also features a hierarchical DL task management framework to achieve desirable load balancing among nodes and enable them to collaborate efficiently to run multiple data-intensive autonomous driving applications. We deployed a total of 18 Soar nodes on existing lampposts on campus, which have been operational for over two years. Our real-world evaluation shows that Soar can support a diverse set of autonomous driving applications and achieve desirable real-time performance and high communication reliability.

|**2024-04-20**|**FisheyeDetNet: Object Detection on Fisheye Surround View Camera Systems for Automated Driving**|Object detection is a mature problem in autonomous driving with pedestrian detection being one of the first deployed algorithms. It has been comprehensively studied in the literature. However, object detection is relatively less explored for fisheye cameras used for surround-view near field sensing. The standard bounding box representation fails in fisheye cameras due to heavy radial distortion, particularly in the periphery. To mitigate this, we explore extending the standard object detection output representation of bounding box. We design rotated bounding boxes, ellipse, generic polygon as polar arc/angle representations and define an instance segmentation mIOU metric to analyze these representations. The proposed model FisheyeDetNet with polygon outperforms others and achieves a mAP score of 49.5 % on Valeo fisheye surround-view dataset for automated driving applications. This dataset has 60K images captured from 4 surround-view cameras across Europe, North America and Asia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study on object detection on fisheye cameras for autonomous driving scenarios. et.al.|[2404.13443](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13443)|null|
|**2024-04-20**|**Social Force Embedded Mixed Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-class Trajectory Prediction**|Accurate prediction of agent motion trajectories is crucial for autonomous driving, contributing to the reduction of collision risks in human-vehicle interactions and ensuring ample response time for other traffic participants. Current research predominantly focuses on traditional deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These methods leverage relative distances to forecast the motion trajectories of a single class of agents. However, in complex traffic scenarios, the motion patterns of various types of traffic participants exhibit inherent randomness and uncertainty. Relying solely on relative distances may not adequately capture the nuanced interaction patterns between different classes of road users. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class trajectory prediction method named the social force embedded mixed graph convolutional network (SFEM-GCN). SFEM-GCN comprises three graph topologies: the semantic graph (SG), position graph (PG), and velocity graph (VG). These graphs encode various of social force relationships among different classes of agents in complex scenes. Specifically, SG utilizes one-hot encoding of agent-class information to guide the construction of graph adjacency matrices based on semantic information. PG and VG create adjacency matrices to capture motion interaction relationships between different classes agents. These graph structures are then integrated into a mixed graph, where learning is conducted using a spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (ST-GCNN). To further enhance prediction performance, we adopt temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to generate the predicted trajectory with fewer parameters. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that SFEM-GCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. et.al.|[2404.13378](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13378)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**BACS: Background Aware Continual Semantic Segmentation**|Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling comprehensive scene understanding for robotic systems. However, generating annotations is challenging, requiring labels for every pixel in an image. In scenarios like autonomous driving, there's a need to progressively incorporate new classes as the operating environment of the deployed agent becomes more complex. For enhanced annotation efficiency, ideally, only pixels belonging to new classes would be annotated. This approach is known as Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS). Besides the common problem of classical catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning setting, CSS suffers from the inherent ambiguity of the background, a phenomenon we refer to as the "background shift'', since pixels labeled as background could correspond to future classes (forward background shift) or previous classes (backward background shift). As a result, continual learning approaches tend to fail. This paper proposes a Backward Background Shift Detector (BACS) to detect previously observed classes based on their distance in the latent space from the foreground centroids of previous steps. Moreover, we propose a modified version of the cross-entropy loss function, incorporating the BACS detector to down-weight background pixels associated with formerly observed classes. To combat catastrophic forgetting, we employ masked feature distillation alongside dark experience replay. Additionally, our approach includes a transformer decoder capable of adjusting to new classes without necessitating an additional classification head. We validate BACS's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on standard CSS benchmarks. et.al.|[2404.13148](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13148)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**A Hybrid Generative and Discriminative PointNet on Unordered Point Sets**|As point cloud provides a natural and flexible representation usable in myriad applications (e.g., robotics and self-driving cars), the ability to synthesize point clouds for analysis becomes crucial. Recently, Xie et al. propose a generative model for unordered point sets in the form of an energy-based model (EBM). Despite the model achieving an impressive performance for point cloud generation, one separate model needs to be trained for each category to capture the complex point set distributions. Besides, their method is unable to classify point clouds directly and requires additional fine-tuning for classification. One interesting question is: Can we train a single network for a hybrid generative and discriminative model of point clouds? A similar question has recently been answered in the affirmative for images, introducing the framework of Joint Energy-based Model (JEM), which achieves high performance in image classification and generation simultaneously. This paper proposes GDPNet, the first hybrid Generative and Discriminative PointNet that extends JEM for point cloud classification and generation. Our GDPNet retains strong discriminative power of modern PointNet classifiers, while generating point cloud samples rivaling state-of-the-art generative approaches. et.al.|[2404.12925](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12925)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Physical Backdoor Attack can Jeopardize Driving with Vision-Large-Language Models**|Vision-Large-Language-models(VLMs) have great application prospects in autonomous driving. Despite the ability of VLMs to comprehend and make decisions in complex scenarios, their integration into safety-critical autonomous driving systems poses serious security risks. In this paper, we propose BadVLMDriver, the first backdoor attack against VLMs for autonomous driving that can be launched in practice using physical objects. Unlike existing backdoor attacks against VLMs that rely on digital modifications, BadVLMDriver uses common physical items, such as a red balloon, to induce unsafe actions like sudden acceleration, highlighting a significant real-world threat to autonomous vehicle safety. To execute BadVLMDriver, we develop an automated pipeline utilizing natural language instructions to generate backdoor training samples with embedded malicious behaviors. This approach allows for flexible trigger and behavior selection, enhancing the stealth and practicality of the attack in diverse scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate BadVLMDriver for two representative VLMs, five different trigger objects, and two types of malicious backdoor behaviors. BadVLMDriver achieves a 92% attack success rate in inducing a sudden acceleration when coming across a pedestrian holding a red balloon. Thus, BadVLMDriver not only demonstrates a critical security risk but also emphasizes the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms to protect against such vulnerabilities in autonomous driving technologies. et.al.|[2404.12916](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12916)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**FipTR: A Simple yet Effective Transformer Framework for Future Instance Prediction in Autonomous Driving**|The future instance prediction from a Bird's Eye View(BEV) perspective is a vital component in autonomous driving, which involves future instance segmentation and instance motion prediction. Existing methods usually rely on a redundant and complex pipeline which requires multiple auxiliary outputs and post-processing procedures. Moreover, estimated errors on each of the auxiliary predictions will lead to degradation of the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fully end-to-end framework named Future Instance Prediction Transformer(FipTR), which views the task as BEV instance segmentation and prediction for future frames. We propose to adopt instance queries representing specific traffic participants to directly estimate the corresponding future occupied masks, and thus get rid of complex post-processing procedures. Besides, we devise a flow-aware BEV predictor for future BEV feature prediction composed of a flow-aware deformable attention that takes backward flow guiding the offset sampling. A novel future instance matching strategy is also proposed to further improve the temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FipTR and its effectiveness under different temporal BEV encoders. et.al.|[2404.12867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12867)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Language-Driven Active Learning for Diverse Open-Set 3D Object Detection**|Object detection is crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, data-driven approaches face challenges when encountering minority or novel objects in the 3D driving scene. In this paper, we propose VisLED, a language-driven active learning framework for diverse open-set 3D Object Detection. Our method leverages active learning techniques to query diverse and informative data samples from an unlabeled pool, enhancing the model's ability to detect underrepresented or novel objects. Specifically, we introduce the Vision-Language Embedding Diversity Querying (VisLED-Querying) algorithm, which operates in both open-world exploring and closed-world mining settings. In open-world exploring, VisLED-Querying selects data points most novel relative to existing data, while in closed-world mining, it mines new instances of known classes. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to random sampling and entropy-querying methods. Our results show that VisLED-Querying consistently outperforms random sampling and offers competitive performance compared to entropy-querying despite the latter's model-optimality, highlighting the potential of VisLED for improving object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. et.al.|[2404.12856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12856)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**A Point-Based Approach to Efficient LiDAR Multi-Task Perception**|Multi-task networks can potentially improve performance and computational efficiency compared to single-task networks, facilitating online deployment. However, current multi-task architectures in point cloud perception combine multiple task-specific point cloud representations, each requiring a separate feature encoder and making the network structures bulky and slow. We propose PAttFormer, an efficient multi-task architecture for joint semantic segmentation and object detection in point clouds that only relies on a point-based representation. The network builds on transformer-based feature encoders using neighborhood attention and grid-pooling and a query-based detection decoder using a novel 3D deformable-attention detection head design. Unlike other LiDAR-based multi-task architectures, our proposed PAttFormer does not require separate feature encoders for multiple task-specific point cloud representations, resulting in a network that is 3x smaller and 1.4x faster while achieving competitive performance on the nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks for autonomous driving perception. Our extensive evaluations show substantial gains from multi-task learning, improving LiDAR semantic segmentation by +1.7% in mIou and 3D object detection by +1.7% in mAP on the nuScenes benchmark compared to the single-task models. et.al.|[2404.12798](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12798)|null|

In this paper, we propose a learning-based ego-lane inference by directly estimating the ego-lane index from a single image. To enhance robust performance, our model incorporates the two-head structure inferring ego-lane in two perspectives simultaneously. Furthermore, we utilize an attention mechanism guided by vanishing point-and-line to adapt to changes in viewpoint without requiring accurate calibration. The high adaptability of our model was validated in diverse environments, devices, and camera mounting points and orientations. et.al.|[2404.12770](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12770)|null|

A central role of this revolution is played by containers, lightweight virtualization technologies that enable the flexible consolidation of complex software applications on a common hardware platform. Despite their widespread adoption, the impact of containerization on fundamental real-time metrics such as end-to-end latency, communication jitter, as well as memory and CPU utilization has remained virtually unexplored. This paper presents a microservice architecture for a real-world autonomous driving application where containers isolate each service. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the benefits in terms of end-to-end latency of such a solution even over standard bare-Linux deployments.

Dragtraffic enables non-experts to generate a variety of realistic driving scenarios for different types of traffic agents through an adaptive mixture expert architecture. We use a regression model to provide a general initial solution and a refinement process based on the conditional diffusion model to ensure diversity. User-customized context is introduced through cross-attention to ensure high controllability.

|**2024-04-18**|**TrACT: A Training Dynamics Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction**|As a safety critical task, autonomous driving requires accurate predictions of road users' future trajectories for safe motion planning, particularly under challenging conditions. Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias. et.al.|[2404.12538](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12538)|null|

While recent methods have made strides in leveraging techniques like the Self Query Layer (SQL) to infer depth from motion, they often overlook the potential of strengthening pose information. In this paper, we introduce SPIdepth, a novel approach that prioritizes enhancing the pose network for improved depth estimation. Building upon the foundation laid by SQL, SPIdepth emphasizes the importance of pose information in capturing fine-grained scene structures. By enhancing the pose network's capabilities, SPIdepth achieves remarkable advancements in scene understanding and depth estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as KITTI and Cityscapes showcase SPIdepth's state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by significant margins. Notably, SPIdepth's performance exceeds that of unsupervised models and, after finetuning on metric data, outperforms all existing methods. Remarkably, SPIdepth achieves these results using only a single image for inference, surpassing even methods that utilize video sequences for inference, thus demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency in real-world applications. Our approach represents a significant leap forward in self-supervised monocular depth estimation, underscoring the importance of strengthening pose information for advancing scene understanding in real-world applications. et.al.|[2404.12501](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12501)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**Practical Considerations for Discrete-Time Implementations of Continuous-Time Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filters**|Safety filters based on control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular method to guarantee safety for uncertified control policies, e.g., as resulting from reinforcement learning. Here, safety is defined as staying in a pre-defined set, the safe set, that adheres to the system's state constraints, e.g., as given by lane boundaries for a self-driving vehicle. In this paper, we examine one commonly overlooked problem that arises in practical implementations of continuous-time CBF-based safety filters. In particular, we look at the issues caused by discrete-time implementations of the continuous-time CBF-based safety filter, especially for cases where the magnitude of the Lie derivative of the CBF with respect to the control input is zero or close to zero. When overlooked, this filter can result in undesirable chattering effects or constraint violations. In this work, we propose three mitigation strategies that allow us to use a continuous-time safety filter in a discrete-time implementation with a local relative degree. Using these strategies in augmented CBF-based safety filters, we achieve safety for all states in the safe set by either using an additional penalty term in the safety filtering objective or modifying the CBF such that those undesired states are not encountered during closed-loop operation. We demonstrate the presented issue and validate our three proposed mitigation strategies in simulation and on a real-world quadrotor. et.al.|[2404.12329](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12329)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**Reducing Bias in Pre-trained Models by Tuning while Penalizing Change**|Deep models trained on large amounts of data often incorporate implicit biases present during training time. If later such a bias is discovered during inference or deployment, it is often necessary to acquire new data and retrain the model. This behavior is especially problematic in critical areas such as autonomous driving or medical decision-making. In these scenarios, new data is often expensive and hard to come by. In this work, we present a method based on change penalization that takes a pre-trained model and adapts the weights to mitigate a previously detected bias. We achieve this by tuning a zero-initialized copy of a frozen pre-trained network. Our method needs very few, in extreme cases only a single, examples that contradict the bias to increase performance. Additionally, we propose an early stopping criterion to modify baselines and reduce overfitting. We evaluate our approach on a well-known bias in skin lesion classification and three other datasets from the domain shift literature. We find that our approach works especially well with very few images. Simple fine-tuning combined with our early stopping also leads to performance benefits for a larger number of tuning samples. et.al.|[2404.12292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12292)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**An Online Spatial-Temporal Graph Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Vehicles**|The autonomous driving industry is expected to grow by over 20 times in the coming decade and, thus, motivate researchers to delve into it. The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride. et.al.|[2404.12256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12256)|null|

This control paradigm has recently received an increasing attention in various application fields, including robotics, autonomous driving, traffic networks, and energy grids, due to its ability to model the competitive nature of self-interested agents with shared resources while incorporating future predictions, dynamic models, and constraints into the decision-making process. In this work, we present the first formal stability analysis based on dissipativity and monotone operator theory that is valid also for non-potential games. Specifically, we derive LMI-based certificates that ensure asymptotic stability and are numerically verifiable. Moreover, we show that, if the agents have decoupled dynamics, the numerical verification can be performed in a scalable manner.

|**2024-04-18**|**S4TP: Social-Suitable and Safety-Sensitive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles**|In public roads, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the challenge of frequent interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which render uncertain driving behavior due to varying social characteristics among humans. To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%. et.al.|[2404.11946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11946)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation**|Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces. et.al.|[2404.11803](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**Multimodal 3D Object Detection on Unseen Domains**|LiDAR datasets for autonomous driving exhibit biases in properties such as point cloud density, range, and object dimensions. As a result, object detection networks trained and evaluated in different environments often experience performance degradation. Domain adaptation approaches assume access to unannotated samples from the test distribution to address this problem. However, in the real world, the exact conditions of deployment and access to samples representative of the test dataset may be unavailable while training. We argue that the more realistic and challenging formulation is to require robustness in performance to unseen target domains. We propose to address this problem in a two-pronged manner. First, we leverage paired LiDAR-image data present in most autonomous driving datasets to perform multimodal object detection. We suggest that working with multimodal features by leveraging both images and LiDAR point clouds for scene understanding tasks results in object detectors more robust to unseen domain shifts. Second, we train a 3D object detector to learn multimodal object features across different distributions and promote feature invariance across these source domains to improve generalizability to unseen target domains. To this end, we propose CLIX $^\text{3D}$, a multimodal fusion and supervised contrastive learning framework for 3D object detection that performs alignment of object features from same-class samples of different domains while pushing the features from different classes apart. We show that CLIX$^\text{3D}$ yields state-of-the-art domain generalization performance under multiple dataset shifts. et.al.|[2404.11764](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11764)|null|

|**2024-04-17**|**VG4D: Vision-Language Model Goes 4D Video Recognition**|Understanding the real world through point cloud video is a crucial aspect of robotics and autonomous driving systems. However, prevailing methods for 4D point cloud recognition have limitations due to sensor resolution, which leads to a lack of detailed information. Recent advances have shown that Vision-Language Models (VLM) pre-trained on web-scale text-image datasets can learn fine-grained visual concepts that can be transferred to various downstream tasks. However, effectively integrating VLM into the domain of 4D point clouds remains an unresolved problem. In this work, we propose the Vision-Language Models Goes 4D (VG4D) framework to transfer VLM knowledge from visual-text pre-trained models to a 4D point cloud network. Our approach involves aligning the 4D encoder's representation with a VLM to learn a shared visual and text space from training on large-scale image-text pairs. By transferring the knowledge of the VLM to the 4D encoder and combining the VLM, our VG4D achieves improved recognition performance. To enhance the 4D encoder, we modernize the classic dynamic point cloud backbone and propose an improved version of PSTNet, im-PSTNet, which can efficiently model point cloud videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for action recognition on both the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset and the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset.

|**2024-04-17**|**Predicting Long-horizon Futures by Conditioning on Geometry and Time**|Our work explores the task of generating future sensor observations conditioned on the past. We are motivated by `predictive coding' concepts from neuroscience as well as robotic applications such as self-driving vehicles. Predictive video modeling is challenging because the future may be multi-modal and learning at scale remains computationally expensive for video processing. To address both challenges, our key insight is to leverage the large-scale pretraining of image diffusion models which can handle multi-modality. We repurpose image models for video prediction by conditioning on new frame timestamps. Such models can be trained with videos of both static and dynamic scenes. To allow them to be trained with modestly-sized datasets, we introduce invariances by factoring out illumination and texture by forcing the model to predict (pseudo) depth, readily obtained for in-the-wild videos via off-the-shelf monocular depth networks. In fact, we show that simply modifying networks to predict grayscale pixels already improves the accuracy of video prediction. Given the extra controllability with timestamp conditioning, we propose sampling schedules that work better than the traditional autoregressive and hierarchical sampling strategies. Motivated by probabilistic metrics from the object forecasting literature, we create a benchmark for video prediction on a diverse set of videos spanning indoor and outdoor scenes and a large vocabulary of objects. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of learning to condition on timestamps, and show the importance of predicting the future with invariant modalities. et.al.|[2404.11554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11554)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**SERENE: A Collusion Resilient Replication-based Verification Framework**|The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology is accompanied by substantial challenges, particularly the reliance on remote task execution without ensuring a reliable and accurate returned results. This reliance on external compute servers, which may be malicious or rogue, represents a major security threat. While researchers have been exploring verifiable computing, and replication-based task verification as a simple, fast, and dependable method to assess the correctness of results. However, colluding malicious workers can easily defeat this method. Existing collusion detection and mitigation solutions often require the use of a trusted third party server or verified tasks which may be hard to guarantee, or solutions that assume the presence of a minority of colluding servers. We propose SERENE a collusion resilient replication-based verification framework that detects, and mitigates colluding workers. Unlike state-of-the-art solutions, SERENE uses a lightweight detection algorithm that detects collusion based on a single verification task. Mitigation requires a two stage process to group the workers and identifying colluding from honest workers. We implement and compare SERENE's performance to Staab et. al, resulting in an average of 50\% and 60\% accuracy improvement in detection and mitigation accuracy respectively. et.al.|[2404.11410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11410)|null|

These detectors are known to be susceptible to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor techniques have primarily been adapted from classification tasks, overlooking deeper vulnerabilities specific to object detection. This paper is dedicated to bridging this gap by introducing Detector Collapse} (DC), a brand-new backdoor attack paradigm tailored for object detection. DC is designed to instantly incapacitate detectors (i.e., severely impairing detector's performance and culminating in a denial-of-service). To this end, we develop two innovative attack schemes: Sponge for triggering widespread misidentifications and Blinding for rendering objects invisible. Remarkably, we introduce a novel poisoning strategy exploiting natural objects, enabling DC to act as a practical backdoor in real-world environments. Our experiments on different detectors across several benchmarks show a significant improvement ( $\sim$10\%-60\% absolute and $\sim$2-7$\times$ relative) in attack efficacy over state-of-the-art attacks. et.al.|[2404.11357](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11357)|null|

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field. et.al.|[2404.11181](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11181)|**[link](https://github.com/chuhengwei/ki_gan)**|

This system expertly identifies and manipulates atomic positions with high precision, autonomously performing tasks such as spectroscopic data acquisition and atomic adjustment. An outstanding feature of AI-SPM is its ability to detect and adapt to surface defects, targeting or avoiding them as necessary. It's also engineered to address typical challenges such as positional drift and tip apex atomic variations due to the thermal effect, ensuring accurate, site-specific surface analyses. Our tests under the demanding conditions of room temperature have demonstrated the robustness of the system, successfully navigating thermal drift and tip fluctuations. During these tests on the Si(111)-(7x7) surface, AI-SPM autonomously identified defect-free regions and performed a large number of current-voltage spectroscopy measurements at different adatom sites, while autonomously compensating for thermal drift and monitoring probe health. These experiments produce extensive data sets that are critical for reliable materials characterization and demonstrate the potential of AI-SPM to significantly improve data acquisition.

To address this issue, we propose D-Aug, a LiDAR data augmentation method tailored for augmenting dynamic scenes. D-Aug extracts objects and inserts them into dynamic scenes, considering the continuity of these objects across consecutive frames. For seamless insertion into dynamic scenes, we propose a reference-guided method that involves dynamic collision detection and rotation alignment. Additionally, we present a pixel-level road identification strategy to efficiently determine suitable insertion positions.

However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM.

This versatility, along with the relatively inexpensive availability of machine vision cameras, played an important role in adopting vision-based environment perception systems in autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, vision-based perception systems can be easily affected by glare in the presence of a bright source of light, such as the sun or the headlights of the oncoming vehicle at night or simply by light reflecting off snow or ice-covered surfaces; scenarios encountered frequently during driving. In this paper, we investigate various glare reduction techniques, including the proposed saturated pixel-aware glare reduction technique for improved performance of the computer vision (CV) tasks employed by the perception layer of AVs. We evaluate these glare reduction methods based on various performance metrics of the CV algorithms used by the perception layer. Specifically, we considered object detection, object recognition, object tracking, depth estimation, and lane detection which are crucial for autonomous driving. The experimental findings validate the efficacy of the proposed glare reduction approach, showcasing enhanced performance across diverse perception tasks and remarkable resilience against varying levels of glare. et.al.|[2404.10992](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10992)|null|

With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computing resources, researchers have been pushing the development of end-to-end AI for autonomous driving, at least in problems of small searching space such as in highway scenarios, and more and more photorealistic simulation will be critical for efficient learning. In this research, we propose a novel game-based end-to-end learning and testing framework for autonomous vehicle highway driving, by learning from human driving skills. Firstly, we utilize the popular game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) to collect highway driving data with our proposed programmable labels. Then, an end-to-end architecture predicts the steering and throttle values that control the vehicle by the image of the game screen. The predicted control values are sent to the game via a virtual controller to keep the vehicle in lane and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The proposed solution is validated in GTA V games, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this end-to-end gamification framework for learning human driving skills. et.al.|[2404.10849](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10849)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**N-Agent Ad Hoc Teamwork**|Current approaches to learning cooperative behaviors in multi-agent settings assume relatively restrictive settings. In standard fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the learning algorithm controls \textit{all} agents in the scenario, while in ad hoc teamwork, the learning algorithm usually assumes control over only a $\textit{single}$ agent in the scenario. However, many cooperative settings in the real world are much less restrictive. For example, in an autonomous driving scenario, a company might train its cars with the same learning algorithm, yet once on the road, these cars must cooperate with cars from another company. Towards generalizing the class of scenarios that cooperative learning methods can address, we introduce $N$-agent ad hoc teamwork, in which a set of autonomous agents must interact and cooperate with dynamically varying numbers and types of teammates at evaluation time. This paper formalizes the problem, and proposes the $\textit{Policy Optimization with Agent Modelling}$ (POAM) algorithm. POAM is a policy gradient, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to the NAHT problem, that enables adaptation to diverse teammate behaviors by learning representations of teammate behaviors. Empirical evaluation on StarCraft II tasks shows that POAM improves cooperative task returns compared to baseline approaches, and enables out-of-distribution generalization to unseen teammates. et.al.|[2404.10740](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10740)|null|

However, current evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in common scenarios, lacking quantifiable and automated assessment in autonomous driving contexts, let alone severe road corner cases that even the state-of-the-art autonomous driving perception systems struggle to handle. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, a novel vision-language benchmark for self-driving, which provides the first automatic and quantitative evaluation of LVLMs for interpretable autonomous driving including general perception, regional perception, and driving suggestions. CODA-LM utilizes the texts to describe the road images, exploiting powerful text-only large language models (LLMs) without image inputs to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in autonomous driving scenarios, which reveals stronger alignment with human preferences than LVLM judges. Experiments demonstrate that even the closed-sourced commercial LVLMs like GPT-4V cannot deal with road corner cases well, suggesting that we are still far from a strong LVLM-powered intelligent driving agent, and we hope our CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote future development. et.al.|[2404.10595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10595)|null|

Yet, the resource constraints in the IoT environment tend to limit such large vision models to be locally deployed, incurring considerable inference latency thereby making it difficult to support real-time applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Edge-cloud collaboration with large-small model co-inference offers a promising approach to achieving high inference accuracy and low latency. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods are tightly coupled with the model architecture and cannot adapt to the dynamic data drifts in heterogeneous IoT environments. To address the issues, we propose LAECIPS, a new edge-cloud collaboration framework. In LAECIPS, both the large vision model on the cloud and the lightweight model on the edge are plug-and-play. We design an edge-cloud collaboration strategy based on hard input mining, optimized for both high accuracy and low latency. We propose to update the edge model and its collaboration strategy with the cloud under the supervision of the large vision model, so as to adapt to the dynamic IoT data streams.

Current scene understanding methods mainly focus on one concrete single task, such as trajectory prediction and risk level evaluation. Although they perform well on specific metrics, the generalization ability is insufficient to adapt to the real traffic complexity and downstream demand diversity. In this study, we propose PreGSU, a generalized pre-trained scene understanding model based on graph attention network to learn the universal interaction and reasoning of traffic scenes to support various downstream tasks. After the feature engineering and sub-graph module, all elements are embedded as nodes to form a dynamic weighted graph. Then, four graph attention layers are applied to learn the relationships among agents and lanes. In the pre-train phase, the understanding model is trained on two self-supervised tasks: Virtual Interaction Force (VIF) modeling and Masked Road Modeling (MRM). Based on the artificial potential field theory, VIF modeling enables PreGSU to capture the agent-to-agent interactions while MRM extracts agent-to-road connections. In the fine-tuning process, the pre-trained parameters are loaded to derive detailed understanding outputs. We conduct validation experiments on two downstream tasks, i.e., trajectory prediction in urban scenario, and intention recognition in highway scenario, to verify the generalized ability and understanding ability. Results show that compared with the baselines, PreGSU achieves better accuracy on both tasks, indicating the potential to be generalized to various scenes and targets.

|**2024-04-15**|**Closing Optical Bloch Equations in waveguide QED: Dynamics, Energetics**|Optical Bloch Equations (OBE) model the dynamics of a classically driven two-level atom coupled to a thermal electromagnetic field. From a global viewpoint, they derive from the unitary evolution of a closed, isolated atom-field system. We study the emergence of the OBE in the case where the driving and the thermal fields are confined in one spatial dimension -- a situation usually found in waveguide-QED. The joint atom-field system forms a "one-dimensional atom" (1D atom) whose closed dynamics can be solved, providing access to light-matter correlations. Such closure of the OBE unveils a new term capturing the driving of the atom by itself, or self-drive, which is proportional to the atom coherences in the energy basis. A 1D atom also constitutes an autonomous, energy-conserving system. Hence, energy exchanges between the atom and the field can be conveniently analyzed as closed first laws, where work-like (heat-like) flows stem from effective unitaries (correlations) exerted by one system on the other. We show that the closed and the open approaches only differ by the atom self-work, which yields a tighter expression of the second law. We quantitatively relate this tightening to the extra-knowledge acquired by closing the OBE. The concepts and effects we introduce deepen our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and its potential for energy management at quantum scales. They can be probed in state-of-the-art quantum hardware, e.g. superconducting and photonic circuits. et.al.|[2404.09648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09648)|null|

However, operating on dense latent spaces introduces a cubic time and space complexity, which limits scalability in terms of perception range or spatial resolution. Existing approaches compress the dense representation using projections like Bird's Eye View (BEV) or Tri-Perspective View (TPV). Although efficient, these projections result in information loss, especially for tasks like semantic occupancy prediction. To address this, we propose SparseOcc, an efficient occupancy network inspired by sparse point cloud processing. It utilizes a lossless sparse latent representation with three key innovations. Firstly, a 3D sparse diffuser performs latent completion using spatially decomposed 3D sparse convolutional kernels. Secondly, a feature pyramid and sparse interpolation enhance scales with information from others. Finally, the transformer head is redesigned as a sparse variant. SparseOcc achieves a remarkable 74.9% reduction on FLOPs over the dense baseline. Interestingly, it also improves accuracy, from 12.8% to 14.1% mIOU, which in part can be attributed to the sparse representation's ability to avoid hallucinations on empty voxels. et.al.|[2404.09502](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09502)|null|

However, in spite of high efficiency, APRs and SCRs have limited accuracy especially in large-scale outdoor scenes; HMs are accurate but need to store a large number of 2D descriptors for matching, resulting in poor efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate framework, called VRS-NeRF, for visual relocalization with sparse neural radiance field. Precisely, we introduce an explicit geometric map (EGM) for 3D map representation and an implicit learning map (ILM) for sparse patches rendering. In this localization process, EGP provides priors of spare 2D points and ILM utilizes these sparse points to render patches with sparse NeRFs for matching. This allows us to discard a large number of 2D descriptors so as to reduce the map size. Moreover, rendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole image reduces the rendering time significantly. This framework inherits the accuracy of HMs and discards their low efficiency. Experiments on 7Scenes, CambridgeLandmarks, and Aachen datasets show that our method gives much better accuracy than APRs and SCRs, and close performance to HMs but is much more efficient. et.al.|[2404.09271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09271)|**[link](https://github.com/feixue94/vrs-nerf)**|
|**2024-04-14**|**Increasing SLAM Pose Accuracy by Ground-to-Satellite Image Registration**|Vision-based localization for autonomous driving has been of great interest among researchers. When a pre-built 3D map is not available, the techniques of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are typically adopted. Due to error accumulation, visual SLAM (vSLAM) usually suffers from long-term drift. This paper proposes a framework to increase the localization accuracy by fusing the vSLAM with a deep-learning-based ground-to-satellite (G2S) image registration method. In this framework, a coarse (spatial correlation bound check) to fine (visual odometry consistency check) method is designed to select the valid G2S prediction. The selected prediction is then fused with the SLAM measurement by solving a scaled pose graph problem. To further increase the localization accuracy, we provide an iterative trajectory fusion pipeline. The proposed framework is evaluated on two well-known autonomous driving datasets, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness in terms of vehicle localization. et.al.|[2404.09169](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09169)|null|
|**2024-04-13**|**Intention-Aware Control Based on Belief-Space Specifications and Stochastic Expansion**|This paper develops a correct-by-design controller for an autonomous vehicle interacting with opponent vehicles with unknown intentions. We use discrete-valued random variables to model unknown intentions. Based on this, we define an intention-aware control problem for an autonomous vehicle and a collection of opponent agents with epistemic uncertainty. To this end, we focus on a control objective specified in the belief space with temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees. et.al.|[2404.09037](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09037)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**WROOM: An Autonomous Driving Approach for Off-Road Navigation**|Off-road navigation is a challenging problem both at the planning level to get a smooth trajectory and at the control level to avoid flipping over, hitting obstacles, or getting stuck at a rough patch. There have been several recent works using classical approaches involving depth map prediction followed by smooth trajectory planning and using a controller to track it. We design an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) system for an autonomous vehicle in off-road environments using a custom-designed simulator in the Unity game engine. We warm-start the agent by imitating a rule-based controller and utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to improve the policy based on a reward that incorporates Control Barrier Functions (CBF), facilitating the agent's ability to generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. The training involves agents concurrently undergoing domain-randomized trials in various environments. We also propose a novel simulation environment to replicate off-road driving scenarios and deploy our proposed approach on a real buggy RC car.

However, the generalization of SLAM algorithms remains a significant challenge, as current datasets often lack scalability in terms of platforms and environments. To address this limitation, we present FusionPortableV2, a multi-sensor SLAM dataset featuring notable sensor diversity, varied motion patterns, and a wide range of environmental scenarios. Our dataset comprises $27$ sequences, spanning over $2.5$ hours and collected from four distinct platforms: a handheld suite, wheeled and legged robots, and vehicles. These sequences cover diverse settings, including buildings, campuses, and urban areas, with a total length of $38.7km$. Additionally, the dataset includes ground-truth (GT) trajectories and RGB point cloud maps covering approximately $0.3km^2$ . To validate the utility of our dataset in advancing SLAM research, we assess several state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the dataset's broad applicability beyond traditional SLAM tasks by investigating its potential for monocular depth estimation.

|**2024-04-12**|**Maturity of Vehicle Digital Twins: From Monitoring to Enabling Autonomous Driving**|Digital twinning of vehicles is an iconic application of digital twins, as the concept of twinning dates back to the twinning of NASA space vehicles. Although digital twins (DTs) in the automotive industry have been recognized for their ability to improve efficiency in design and manufacturing, their potential to enhance land vehicle operation has yet to be fully explored. Most existing DT research on vehicle operations, aside from the existing body of work on autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), focuses on electrified passenger cars. However, the use and value of twinning varies depending on the goal, whether it is to provide cost-efficient and sustainable freight transport without disruptions, sustainable public transport focused on passenger well-being, or fully autonomous vehicle operation. In this context, DTs are used for a range of applications, from real-time battery health monitoring to enabling fully autonomous vehicle operations. This leads to varying requirements, complexities, and maturities of the implemented DT solutions. This paper analyzes recent trends in DT-driven efficiency gains for freight, public, and autonomous vehicles and discusses their required level of maturity based on a maturity tool. The application of our DT maturity tool reveals that most DTs have reached level 3 and enable real-time monitoring. Additionally, DTs of level 5 already exist in closed environments, allowing for restricted autonomous operation. et.al.|[2404.08438](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08438)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**Transfer Learning Study of Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Predictions**|Trajectory planning in autonomous driving is highly dependent on predicting the emergent behavior of other road users. Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world. et.al.|[2404.08271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08271)|null|
|**2024-04-11**|**Real-Time Detection and Analysis of Vehicles and Pedestrians using Deep Learning**|Computer vision, particularly vehicle and pedestrian identification is critical to the evolution of autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and video surveillance. Current traffic monitoring systems confront major difficulty in recognizing small objects and pedestrians effectively in real-time, posing a serious risk to public safety and contributing to traffic inefficiency. Recognizing these difficulties, our project focuses on the creation and validation of an advanced deep-learning framework capable of processing complex visual input for precise, real-time recognition of cars and people in a variety of environmental situations. On a dataset representing complicated urban settings, we trained and evaluated different versions of the YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models. The YOLOv8 Large version proved to be the most effective, especially in pedestrian recognition, with great precision and robustness. The results, which include Mean Average Precision and recall rates, demonstrate the model's ability to dramatically improve traffic monitoring and safety. This study makes an important addition to real-time, reliable detection in computer vision, establishing new benchmarks for traffic management systems. et.al.|[2404.08081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08081)|null|
|**2024-04-11**|**VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning**|Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world. et.al.|[2404.08021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021)|null|
|**2024-04-11**|**Sparse Laneformer**|Lane detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving, and has achieved great progress as deep learning emerges. Previous anchor-based methods often design dense anchors, which highly depend on the training dataset and remain fixed during inference. We analyze that dense anchors are not necessary for lane detection, and propose a transformer-based lane detection framework based on a sparse anchor mechanism. To this end, we generate sparse anchors with position-aware lane queries and angle queries instead of traditional explicit anchors. We adopt Horizontal Perceptual Attention (HPA) to aggregate the lane features along the horizontal direction, and adopt Lane-Angle Cross Attention (LACA) to perform interactions between lane queries and angle queries. We also propose Lane Perceptual Attention (LPA) based on deformable cross attention to further refine the lane predictions. Our method, named Sparse Laneformer, is easy-to-implement and end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sparse Laneformer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., surpassing Laneformer by 3.0% F1 score and O2SFormer by 0.7% F1 score with fewer MACs on CULane with the same ResNet-34 backbone. et.al.|[2404.07821](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07821)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**NeuroNCAP: Photorealistic Closed-loop Safety Testing for Autonomous Driving**|We present a versatile NeRF-based simulator for testing autonomous driving (AD) software systems, designed with a focus on sensor-realistic closed-loop evaluation and the creation of safety-critical scenarios. The simulator learns from sequences of real-world driving sensor data and enables reconfigurations and renderings of new, unseen scenarios. In this work, we use our simulator to test the responses of AD models to safety-critical scenarios inspired by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP). Our evaluation reveals that, while state-of-the-art end-to-end planners excel in nominal driving scenarios in an open-loop setting, they exhibit critical flaws when navigating our safety-critical scenarios in a closed-loop setting. This highlights the need for advancements in the safety and real-world usability of end-to-end planners. By publicly releasing our simulator and scenarios as an easy-to-run evaluation suite, we invite the research community to explore, refine, and validate their AD models in controlled, yet highly configurable and challenging sensor-realistic environments.

|**2024-04-11**|**Homography Guided Temporal Fusion for Road Line and Marking Segmentation**|Reliable segmentation of road lines and markings is critical to autonomous driving. Our work is motivated by the observations that road lines and markings are (1) frequently occluded in the presence of moving vehicles, shadow, and glare and (2) highly structured with low intra-class shape variance and overall high appearance consistency. To solve these issues, we propose a Homography Guided Fusion (HomoFusion) module to exploit temporally-adjacent video frames for complementary cues facilitating the correct classification of the partially occluded road lines or markings. To reduce computational complexity, a novel surface normal estimator is proposed to establish spatial correspondences between the sampled frames, allowing the HomoFusion module to perform a pixel-to-pixel attention mechanism in updating the representation of the occluded road lines or markings. Experiments on ApolloScape, a large-scale lane mark segmentation dataset, and ApolloScape Night with artificial simulated night-time road conditions, demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing SOTA lane mark segmentation models with less than 9\% of their parameters and computational complexity. We show that exploiting available camera intrinsic data and ground plane assumption for cross-frame correspondence can lead to a light-weight network with significantly improved performances in speed and accuracy. We also prove the versatility of our HomoFusion approach by applying it to the problem of water puddle segmentation and achieving SOTA performance. et.al.|[2404.07626](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07626)|**[link](https://github.com/shanwang-shan/homofusion)**|
|**2024-04-11**|**Can Vehicle Motion Planning Generalize to Realistic Long-tail Scenarios?**|Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of rare and diverse traffic scenarios. Current state-of-the-art planners are mostly evaluated on real-world datasets like nuScenes (open-loop) or nuPlan (closed-loop). In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation method since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly covers basic driving scenarios. This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios. We assess existing state-of-the-art planners on our benchmark and show that neither rule-based nor learning-based planners can safely navigate the interPlan scenarios.   A recently evolving direction is the usage of foundation models like large language models (LLM) to handle generalization. We evaluate an LLM-only planner and introduce a novel hybrid planner that combines an LLM-based behavior planner with a rule-based motion planner that achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. et.al.|[2404.07569](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07569)|**[link](https://github.com/mh0797/interplan)**|
|**2024-04-11**|**PillarTrack: Redesigning Pillar-based Transformer Network for Single Object Tracking on Point Clouds**|LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical issue in robotics and autonomous driving. It aims to obtain accurate 3D BBox from the search area based on similarity or motion. However, existing 3D SOT methods usually follow the point-based pipeline, where the sampling operation inevitably leads to redundant or lost information, resulting in unexpected performance. To address these issues, we propose PillarTrack, a pillar-based 3D single object tracking framework. Firstly, we transform sparse point clouds into dense pillars to preserve the local and global geometrics. Secondly, we introduce a Pyramid-type Encoding Pillar Feature Encoder (PE-PFE) design to help the feature representation of each pillar. Thirdly, we present an efficient Transformer-based backbone from the perspective of modality differences. Finally, we construct our PillarTrack tracker based above designs. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI and nuScenes dataset and enables real-time tracking speed. We hope our work could encourage the community to rethink existing 3D SOT tracker designs.We will open source our code to the research community in https://github.com/StiphyJay/PillarTrack. et.al.|[2404.07495](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07495)|**[link](https://github.com/stiphyjay/pillartrack)**|
|**2024-04-10**|**Incorporating Explanations into Human-Machine Interfaces for Trust and Situation Awareness in Autonomous Vehicles**|Autonomous vehicles often make complex decisions via machine learning-based predictive models applied to collected sensor data. While this combination of methods provides a foundation for real-time actions, self-driving behavior primarily remains opaque to end users. In this sense, explainability of real-time decisions is a crucial and natural requirement for building trust in autonomous vehicles. Moreover, as autonomous vehicles still cause serious traffic accidents for various reasons, timely conveyance of upcoming hazards to road users can help improve scene understanding and prevent potential risks. Hence, there is also a need to supply autonomous vehicles with user-friendly interfaces for effective human-machine teaming. Motivated by this problem, we study the role of explainable AI and human-machine interface jointly in building trust in vehicle autonomy. We first present a broad context of the explanatory human-machine systems with the "3W1H" (what, whom, when, how) approach. Based on these findings, we present a situation awareness framework for calibrating users' trust in self-driving behavior. Finally, we perform an experiment on our framework, conduct a user study on it, and validate the empirical findings with hypothesis testing. et.al.|[2404.07383](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07383)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**Sequential Decision Making with Expert Demonstrations under Unobserved Heterogeneity**|We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary demonstrations from experts who made their decisions based on unobserved contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different tasks than what the learner faces. This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as a zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning setting with an unknown task distribution and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved tasks are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), a non-parametric empirical Bayes approach that utilizes the principle of maximum entropy to establish an informative prior over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning and online algorithms for multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning, showcasing the utility of our approach in leveraging expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups. et.al.|[2404.07266](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07266)|**[link](https://github.com/vdblm/ExPerior)**|
|**2024-04-10**|**Identification of Fine-grained Systematic Errors via Controlled Scene Generation**|Many safety-critical applications, especially in autonomous driving, require reliable object detectors. They can be very effectively assisted by a method to search for and identify potential failures and systematic errors before these detectors are deployed. Systematic errors are characterized by combinations of attributes such as object location, scale, orientation, and color, as well as the composition of their respective backgrounds. To identify them, one must rely on something other than real images from a test set because they do not account for very rare but possible combinations of attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a pipeline for generating realistic synthetic scenes with fine-grained control, allowing the creation of complex scenes with multiple objects. Our approach, BEV2EGO, allows for a realistic generation of the complete scene with road-contingent control that maps 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) scene configurations to a first-person view (EGO). In addition, we propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation to select the most appropriate generative outpainting model for BEV2EGO. We further use it to perform a systematic analysis of multiple state-of-the-art object detection models and discover differences between them. et.al.|[2404.07045](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07045)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**SparseAD: Sparse Query-Centric Paradigm for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Driving**|End-to-End paradigms use a unified framework to implement multi-tasks in an autonomous driving system. Despite simplicity and clarity, the performance of end-to-end autonomous driving methods on sub-tasks is still far behind the single-task methods. Meanwhile, the widely used dense BEV features in previous end-to-end methods make it costly to extend to more modalities or tasks. In this paper, we propose a Sparse query-centric paradigm for end-to-end Autonomous Driving (SparseAD), where the sparse queries completely represent the whole driving scenario across space, time and tasks without any dense BEV representation. Concretely, we design a unified sparse architecture for perception tasks including detection, tracking, and online mapping. Moreover, we revisit motion prediction and planning, and devise a more justifiable motion planner framework. On the challenging nuScenes dataset, SparseAD achieves SOTA full-task performance among end-to-end methods and significantly narrows the performance gap between end-to-end paradigms and single-task methods. Codes will be released soon. et.al.|[2404.06892](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06892)|null|

Due to the consideration of sensor costs and the advantages of visual data in color information, in practical applications, 3D lane detection based on monocular vision is one of the important research directions in the field of autonomous driving, which has attracted more and more attention in both industry and academia. Unfortunately, recent progress in visual perception seems insufficient to develop completely reliable 3D lane detection algorithms, which also hinders the development of vision-based fully autonomous self-driving cars, i.e., achieving level 5 autonomous driving, driving like human-controlled cars. This is one of the conclusions drawn from this review paper: there is still a lot of room for improvement and significant improvements are still needed in the 3D lane detection algorithm for autonomous driving cars using visual sensors. Motivated by this, this review defines, analyzes, and reviews the current achievements in the field of 3D lane detection research, and the vast majority of the current progress relies heavily on computationally complex deep learning models.

|**2024-04-10**|**Sparse Points to Dense Clouds: Enhancing 3D Detection with Limited LiDAR Data**|3D detection is a critical task that enables machines to identify and locate objects in three-dimensional space. It has a broad range of applications in several fields, including autonomous driving, robotics and augmented reality. Monocular 3D detection is attractive as it requires only a single camera, however, it lacks the accuracy and robustness required for real world applications. High resolution LiDAR on the other hand, can be expensive and lead to interference problems in heavy traffic given their active transmissions. We propose a balanced approach that combines the advantages of monocular and point cloud-based 3D detection. Our method requires only a small number of 3D points, that can be obtained from a low-cost, low-resolution sensor. Specifically, we use only 512 points, which is just 1% of a full LiDAR frame in the KITTI dataset. Our method reconstructs a complete 3D point cloud from this limited 3D information combined with a single image. The reconstructed 3D point cloud and corresponding image can be used by any multi-modal off-the-shelf detector for 3D object detection. By using the proposed network architecture with an off-the-shelf multi-modal 3D detector, the accuracy of 3D detection improves by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art monocular detection methods and 6% to 9% compare to the baseline multi-modal methods on KITTI and JackRabbot datasets. et.al.|[2404.06715](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06715)|null|

However, the correct segmentation semantics - where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? - change depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains, fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially diverse; and data sharing (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we propose the concept of semantic boosting: given a zero-shot foundation model, guide its segmentation and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain microstructure segmentation for transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and mask merging operations. We demonstrate a zero-shot performance increase of (absolute) +21.35%, +12.6%, +5.27% in mean IoU, and a -9.91%, -18.42%, -4.06% drop in mean false positive masks across images of three difficulty classes over vanilla SAM (ViT-L). et.al.|[2404.06638](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06638)|null|

Vision-based online road reconstruction promisingly captures road information in advance. Existing solutions like monocular depth estimation and stereo matching suffer from modest performance. The recent technique of Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception provides immense potential to more reliable and accurate reconstruction. This paper uniformly proposes two simple yet effective models for road elevation reconstruction in BEV named RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo, which estimate road elevation with monocular and stereo images, respectively. The former directly fits elevation values based on voxel features queried from image view, while the latter efficiently recognizes road elevation patterns based on BEV volume representing discrepancy between left and right voxel features. Insightful analyses reveal their consistence and difference with perspective view. Experiments on real-world dataset verify the models' effectiveness and superiority. Elevation errors of RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo achieve 1.83cm and 0.56cm, respectively. The estimation performance improves by 50\% in BEV based on monocular image. Our models are promising for practical applications, providing valuable references for vision-based BEV perception in autonomous driving.

|**2024-04-11**|**HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention**|Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, current autonomous driving systems, which are primarily based on data-driven approaches, exhibit deficiencies in interpretability, generalization, and continuing learning capabilities. In addition, the single-vehicle autonomous driving systems lack of the ability of collaboration and negotiation with other vehicles, which is crucial for the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems. In order to address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to develop a novel framework, AgentsCoDriver, to enable multiple vehicles to conduct collaborative driving. AgentsCoDriver consists of five modules: observation module, reasoning engine, cognitive memory module, reinforcement reflection module, and communication module. It can accumulate knowledge, lessons, and experiences over time by continuously interacting with the environment, thereby making itself capable of lifelong learning. In addition, by leveraging the communication module, different agents can exchange information and realize negotiation and collaboration in complex traffic environments.

|**2024-04-09**|**Label-Efficient 3D Object Detection For Road-Side Units**|Occlusion presents a significant challenge for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Collaborative perception has recently attracted a large research interest thanks to the ability to enhance the perception of autonomous vehicles via deep information fusion with intelligent roadside units (RSU), thus minimizing the impact of occlusion. While significant advancement has been made, the data-hungry nature of these methods creates a major hurdle for their real-world deployment, particularly due to the need for annotated RSU data. Manually annotating the vast amount of RSU data required for training is prohibitively expensive, given the sheer number of intersections and the effort involved in annotating point clouds. We address this challenge by devising a label-efficient object detection method for RSU based on unsupervised object discovery. Our paper introduces two new modules: one for object discovery based on a spatial-temporal aggregation of point clouds, and another for refinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on a small portion of annotated data allows our object discovery models to narrow the performance gap with, or even surpass, fully supervised models. Extensive experiments are carried out in simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate our method. et.al.|[2404.06256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06256)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**ActNetFormer: Transformer-ResNet Hybrid Method for Semi-Supervised Action Recognition in Videos**|Human action or activity recognition in videos is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in surveillance and monitoring, self-driving cars, sports analytics, human-robot interaction and many more. Traditional supervised methods require large annotated datasets for training, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes a novel approach using Cross-Architecture Pseudo-Labeling with contrastive learning for semi-supervised action recognition. Our framework leverages both labeled and unlabelled data to robustly learn action representations in videos, combining pseudo-labeling with contrastive learning for effective learning from both types of samples. We introduce a novel cross-architecture approach where 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and video transformers (VIT) are utilised to capture different aspects of action representations; hence we call it ActNetFormer. The 3D CNNs excel at capturing spatial features and local dependencies in the temporal domain, while VIT excels at capturing long-range dependencies across frames. By integrating these complementary architectures within the ActNetFormer framework, our approach can effectively capture both local and global contextual information of an action. This comprehensive representation learning enables the model to achieve better performance in semi-supervised action recognition tasks by leveraging the strengths of each of these architectures. Experimental results on standard action recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach performs better than the existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only a fraction of labeled data.

|**2024-04-09**|**Hierarchical Insights: Exploiting Structural Similarities for Reliable 3D Semantic Segmentation**|Safety-critical applications like autonomous driving call for robust 3D environment perception algorithms which can withstand highly diverse and ambiguous surroundings. The predictive performance of any classification model strongly depends on the underlying dataset and the prior knowledge conveyed by the annotated labels. While the labels provide a basis for the learning process, they usually fail to represent inherent relations between the classes - representations, which are a natural element of the human perception system. We propose a training strategy which enables a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation model to learn structural relationships between the different classes through abstraction. We achieve this by implicitly modeling those relationships through a learning rule for hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC). With a detailed analysis we show, how this training strategy not only improves the model's confidence calibration, but also preserves additional information for downstream tasks like fusion, prediction and planning. et.al.|[2404.06124](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06124)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**Passive None-line-of-sight imaging with arbitrary scene condition and detection pattern in small amount of prior data**|Passive Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging requires to reconstruct objects which cannot be seen in line without using external controllable light sources. It can be widely applied in areas like counter-terrorism, urban-Warfare, autonomous-driving and robot-vision. Existing methods for passive NLOS typically required extensive prior information and significant computational resources to establish light transport matrices or train neural networks. These constraints pose significant challenges for transitioning models to different NLOS scenarios. Thus, the pressing issue in passive NLOS imaging currently lies in whether it is possible to estimate the light transport matrices which corresponding to relay surfaces and scenes, as well as the specific distribution of targets, with a small amount of prior knowledge. In this work, we hypothesized a high-dimensional manifold and mathematically proved its existence. Within this high-dimensional manifold, the structural information of obscured targets is minimally disrupted. Therefore, we proposed a universal framework named High-Dimensional Projection Selection (HDPS) which can establish this high-dimensional manifold and output its projection onto corresponding surfaces on low-dimensional. HDPS can be applied to most mature network architectures and estimate the distribution of target and light spot obtained by camera with only minimal prior data. Certainly, with the help of the estimated information, it can establish a high-dimensional manifold consisting of target and input. As demonstrated in experiment, our framework, even when applied to the most basic network structures, can achieve higher accuracy results with significantly smaller amounts of prior data. Thereby, our approach enables passive NLOS scenarios to reconstruct target by limited prior data and computational resources. et.al.|[2404.06015](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06015)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Residual Chain Prediction for Autonomous Driving Path Planning**|In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous driving systems, the refinement of path planning algorithms is paramount for navigating vehicles through dynamic environments, particularly in complex urban scenarios. Traditional path planning algorithms, which are heavily reliant on static rules and manually defined parameters, often fall short in such contexts, highlighting the need for more adaptive, learning-based approaches. Among these, behavior cloning emerges as a noteworthy strategy for its simplicity and efficiency, especially within the realm of end-to-end path planning. However, behavior cloning faces challenges, such as covariate shift when employing traditional Manhattan distance as the metric. Addressing this, our study introduces the novel concept of Residual Chain Loss. Residual Chain Loss dynamically adjusts the loss calculation process to enhance the temporal dependency and accuracy of predicted path points, significantly improving the model's performance without additional computational overhead. Through testing on the nuScenes dataset, we underscore the method's substantial advancements in addressing covariate shift, facilitating dynamic loss adjustments, and ensuring seamless integration with end-to-end path planning frameworks. Our findings highlight the potential of Residual Chain Loss to revolutionize planning component of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant step forward in the quest for level 5 autonomous driving system. et.al.|[2404.05423](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05423)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Human Detection from 4D Radar Data in Low-Visibility Field Conditions**|Autonomous driving technology is increasingly being used on public roads and in industrial settings such as mines. While it is essential to detect pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles, adverse field conditions negatively affect the performance of classical sensors such as cameras or lidars. Radar, on the other hand, is a promising modality that is less affected by, e.g., dust, smoke, water mist or fog. In particular, modern 4D imaging radars provide target responses across the range, vertical angle, horizontal angle and Doppler velocity dimensions. We propose TMVA4D, a CNN architecture that leverages this 4D radar modality for semantic segmentation. The CNN is trained to distinguish between the background and person classes based on a series of 2D projections of the 4D radar data that include the elevation, azimuth, range, and Doppler velocity dimensions. We also outline the process of compiling a novel dataset consisting of data collected in industrial settings with a car-mounted 4D radar and describe how the ground-truth labels were generated from reference thermal images. Using TMVA4D on this dataset, we achieve an mIoU score of 78.2% and an mDice score of 86.1%, evaluated on the two classes background and person et.al.|[2404.05307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05307)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Detecting Every Object from Events**|Object detection is critical in autonomous driving, and it is more practical yet challenging to localize objects of unknown categories: an endeavour known as Class-Agnostic Object Detection (CAOD). Existing studies on CAOD predominantly rely on ordinary cameras, but these frame-based sensors usually have high latency and limited dynamic range, leading to safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this study, we turn to a new modality enabled by the so-called event camera, featured by its sub-millisecond latency and high dynamic range, for robust CAOD. We propose Detecting Every Object in Events (DEOE), an approach tailored for achieving high-speed, class-agnostic open-world object detection in event-based vision. Built upon the fast event-based backbone: recurrent vision transformer, we jointly consider the spatial and temporal consistencies to identify potential objects. The discovered potential objects are assimilated as soft positive samples to avoid being suppressed as background. Moreover, we introduce a disentangled objectness head to separate the foreground-background classification and novel object discovery tasks, enhancing the model's generalization in localizing novel objects while maintaining a strong ability to filter out the background. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our proposed DEOE in comparison with three strong baseline methods that integrate the state-of-the-art event-based object detector with advancements in RGB-based CAOD.

Previous methods for roadside 3D object detection mainly focus on modeling the depth or height of objects, neglecting the stationary of cameras and the characteristic of inter-frame consistency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely MOSE, for MOnocular 3D object detection with Scene cuEs. The scene cues are the frame-invariant scene-specific features, which are crucial for object localization and can be intuitively regarded as the height between the surface of the real road and the virtual ground plane. In the proposed framework, a scene cue bank is designed to aggregate scene cues from multiple frames of the same scene with a carefully designed extrinsic augmentation strategy. Then, a transformer-based decoder lifts the aggregated scene cues as well as the 3D position embeddings for 3D object location, which boosts generalization ability in heterologous scenes. The extensive experiment results on two public benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, which surpasses the existing methods by a large margin. et.al.|[2404.05280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05280)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**UniMix: Towards Domain Adaptive and Generalizable LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather**|LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) is a critical task in autonomous driving and has achieved promising progress. However, prior LSS methods are conventionally investigated and evaluated on datasets within the same domain in clear weather. The robustness of LSS models in unseen scenes and all weather conditions is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in real applications. To this end, we propose UniMix, a universal method that enhances the adaptability and generalizability of LSS models. UniMix first leverages physically valid adverse weather simulation to construct a Bridge Domain, which serves to bridge the domain gap between the clear weather scenes and the adverse weather scenes. Then, a Universal Mixing operator is defined regarding spatial, intensity, and semantic distributions to create the intermediate domain with mixed samples from given domains. Integrating the proposed two techniques into a teacher-student framework, UniMix efficiently mitigates the domain gap and enables LSS models to learn weather-robust and domain-invariant representations. We devote UniMix to two main setups: 1) unsupervised domain adaption, adapting the model from the clear weather source domain to the adverse weather target domain; 2) domain generalization, learning a model that generalizes well to unseen scenes in adverse weather. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UniMix across different tasks and datasets, all achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released. et.al.|[2404.05145](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05145)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Better Monocular 3D Detectors with LiDAR from the Past**|Accurate 3D object detection is crucial to autonomous driving. Though LiDAR-based detectors have achieved impressive performance, the high cost of LiDAR sensors precludes their widespread adoption in affordable vehicles. Camera-based detectors are cheaper alternatives but often suffer inferior performance compared to their LiDAR-based counterparts due to inherent depth ambiguities in images. In this work, we seek to improve monocular 3D detectors by leveraging unlabeled historical LiDAR data. Specifically, at inference time, we assume that the camera-based detectors have access to multiple unlabeled LiDAR scans from past traversals at locations of interest (potentially from other high-end vehicles equipped with LiDAR sensors). Under this setup, we proposed a novel, simple, and end-to-end trainable framework, termed AsyncDepth, to effectively extract relevant features from asynchronous LiDAR traversals of the same location for monocular 3D detectors. We show consistent and significant performance gain (up to 9 AP) across multiple state-of-the-art models and datasets with a negligible additional latency of 9.66 ms and a small storage cost. et.al.|[2404.05139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05139)|**[link](https://github.com/yurongyou/asyncdepth)**|

However, implementing NLOS imaging on a moving camera remains an open area of research. Existing NLOS imaging methods rely on time-resolved detectors and laser configurations that require precise optical alignment, making it difficult to deploy them in dynamic environments. This work proposes a data-driven approach to NLOS imaging, PathFinder, that can be used with a standard RGB camera mounted on a small, power-constrained mobile robot, such as an aerial drone. Our experimental pipeline is designed to accurately estimate the 2D trajectory of a person who moves in a Manhattan-world environment while remaining hidden from the camera's field-of-view. We introduce a novel approach to process a sequence of dynamic successive frames in a line-of-sight (LOS) video using an attention-based neural network that performs inference in real-time. The method also includes a preprocessing selection metric that analyzes images from a moving camera which contain multiple vertical planar surfaces, such as walls and building facades, and extracts planes that return maximum NLOS information. We validate the approach on in-the-wild scenes using a drone for video capture, thus demonstrating low-cost NLOS imaging in dynamic capture environments. et.al.|[2404.05024](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05024)|null|

Since the image perspective has depth ambiguity, the challenges of Mono3D lie in understanding 3D scene geometry and reconstructing 3D object information from a single image. Previous methods attempted to transfer 3D information directly from the LiDAR-based teacher to the camera-based student. However, a considerable gap in feature representation makes direct cross-modal distillation inefficient, resulting in a significant performance deterioration between the LiDAR-based teacher and the camera-based student. To address this issue, we propose the Teaching Assistant Knowledge Distillation (MonoTAKD) to break down the learning objective by integrating intra-modal distillation with cross-modal residual distillation. In particular, we employ a strong camera-based teaching assistant model to distill powerful visual knowledge effectively through intra-modal distillation. Subsequently, we introduce the cross-modal residual distillation to transfer the 3D spatial cues. By acquiring both visual knowledge and 3D spatial cues, the predictions of our approach are rigorously evaluated on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance in Mono3D. et.al.|[2404.04910](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04910)|null|
|**2024-04-07**|**Prompting Multi-Modal Tokens to Enhance End-to-End Autonomous Driving Imitation Learning with LLMs**|The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the realm of reinforcement learning, particularly as planners, has garnered a significant degree of attention in recent scholarly literature. However, a substantial proportion of existing research predominantly focuses on planning models for robotics that transmute the outputs derived from perception models into linguistic forms, thus adopting a `pure-language' strategy. In this research, we propose a hybrid End-to-End learning framework for autonomous driving by combining basic driving imitation learning with LLMs based on multi-modality prompt tokens. Instead of simply converting perception results from the separated train model into pure language input, our novelty lies in two aspects. 1) The end-to-end integration of visual and LiDAR sensory input into learnable multi-modality tokens, thereby intrinsically alleviating description bias by separated pre-trained perception models. 2) Instead of directly letting LLMs drive, this paper explores a hybrid setting of letting LLMs help the driving model correct mistakes and complicated scenarios. The results of our experiments suggest that the proposed methodology can attain driving scores of 49.21%, coupled with an impressive route completion rate of 91.34% in the offline evaluation conducted via CARLA. These performance metrics are comparable to the most advanced driving models. et.al.|[2404.04869](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04869)|null|

However, these systems often struggle in low-light conditions, potentially compromising their performance and safety. To address this, our paper introduces LightDiff, a domain-tailored framework designed to enhance the low-light image quality for autonomous driving applications. Specifically, we employ a multi-condition controlled diffusion model. LightDiff works without any human-collected paired data, leveraging a dynamic data degradation process instead. It incorporates a novel multi-condition adapter that adaptively controls the input weights from different modalities, including depth maps, RGB images, and text captions, to effectively illuminate dark scenes while maintaining context consistency. Furthermore, to align the enhanced images with the detection model's knowledge, LightDiff employs perception-specific scores as rewards to guide the diffusion training process through reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes datasets demonstrate that LightDiff can significantly improve the performance of several state-of-the-art 3D detectors in night-time conditions while achieving high visual quality scores, highlighting its potential to safeguard autonomous driving. et.al.|[2404.04804](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04804)|null|

Existing privacy protection techniques are unable to efficiently protect such data. For example, Differential Privacy (DP) that is an emerging technique protects data with strong privacy guarantee cannot effectively protect visual features of exposed image dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework VisualMixer that protects the training data of visual DNN tasks by pixel shuffling, while not injecting any noises. VisualMixer utilizes a new privacy metric called Visual Feature Entropy (VFE) to effectively quantify the visual features of an image from both biological and machine vision aspects. In VisualMixer, we devise a task-agnostic image obfuscation method to protect the visual privacy of data for DNN training and inference. For each image, it determines regions for pixel shuffling in the image and the sizes of these regions according to the desired VFE. It shuffles pixels both in the spatial domain and in the chromatic channel space in the regions without injecting noises so that it can prevent visual features from being discerned and recognized, while incurring negligible accuracy loss. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VisualMixer can effectively preserve the visual privacy with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., at average 2.35 percentage points of model accuracy loss, and almost no performance degradation on model training. et.al.|[2404.04098](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04098)|null|

Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.

Onboard compute budgets typically limit the accuracy of real-time systems. In this work we propose methods of improving motion forecasting systems subject to limited compute budgets by combining model ensemble and distillation techniques. The use of ensembles of deep neural networks has been shown to improve generalization accuracy in many application domains. We first demonstrate significant performance gains by creating a large ensemble of optimized single models. We then develop a generalized framework to distill motion forecasting model ensembles into small student models which retain high performance with a fraction of the computing cost. For this study we focus on the task of motion forecasting using real world data from autonomous driving systems. We develop ensemble models that are very competitive on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse leaderboards.

However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks. et.al.|[2404.03799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03799)|null|

However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. This is achieved through the adoption of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes respond to several classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. These findings suggest that the incorporation of dendrites can make learning in ANNs precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs. et.al.|[2404.03708](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03708)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**Is CLIP the main roadblock for fine-grained open-world perception?**|Modern applications increasingly demand flexible computer vision models that adapt to novel concepts not encountered during training. This necessity is pivotal in emerging domains like extended reality, robotics, and autonomous driving, which require the ability to respond to open-world stimuli. A key ingredient is the ability to identify objects based on free-form textual queries defined at inference time - a task known as open-vocabulary object detection. Multimodal backbones like CLIP are the main enabling technology for current open-world perception solutions. Despite performing well on generic queries, recent studies highlighted limitations on the fine-grained recognition capabilities in open-vocabulary settings - i.e., for distinguishing subtle object features like color, shape, and material. In this paper, we perform a detailed examination of these open-vocabulary object recognition limitations to find the root cause. We evaluate the performance of CLIP, the most commonly used vision-language backbone, against a fine-grained object-matching benchmark, revealing interesting analogies between the limitations of open-vocabulary object detectors and their backbones. Experiments suggest that the lack of fine-grained understanding is caused by the poor separability of object characteristics in the CLIP latent space. Therefore, we try to understand whether fine-grained knowledge is present in CLIP embeddings but not exploited at inference time due, for example, to the unsuitability of the cosine similarity matching function, which may discard important object characteristics. Our preliminary experiments show that simple CLIP latent-space re-projections help separate fine-grained concepts, paving the way towards the development of backbones inherently able to process fine-grained details.

Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems. et.al.|[2404.03493](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493)|null|

|**2024-04-03**|**Ego-Motion Aware Target Prediction Module for Robust Multi-Object Tracking**|Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a prominent task in computer vision with application in autonomous driving, responsible for the simultaneous tracking of multiple object trajectories. Detection-based multi-object tracking (DBT) algorithms detect objects using an independent object detector and predict the imminent location of each target. Conventional prediction methods in DBT utilize Kalman Filter(KF) to extrapolate the target location in the upcoming frames by supposing a constant velocity motion model. These methods are especially hindered in autonomous driving applications due to dramatic camera motion or unavailable detections. Such limitations lead to tracking failures manifested by numerous identity switches and disrupted trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel KF-based prediction module called the Ego-motion Aware Target Prediction (EMAP) module by focusing on the integration of camera motion and depth information with object motion models. Our proposed method decouples the impact of camera rotational and translational velocity from the object trajectories by reformulating the Kalman Filter. This reformulation enables us to reject the disturbances caused by camera motion and maximizes the reliability of the object motion model. We integrate our module with four state-of-the-art base MOT algorithms, namely OC-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT. In particular, our evaluation on the KITTI MOT dataset demonstrates that EMAP remarkably drops the number of identity switches (IDSW) of OC-SORT and Deep OC-SORT by 73% and 21%, respectively. At the same time, it elevates other performance metrics such as HOTA by more than 5%.

LidarDM stands out with two unprecedented capabilities in LiDAR generative modeling: (i) LiDAR generation guided by driving scenarios, offering significant potential for autonomous driving simulations, and (ii) 4D LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling the creation of realistic and temporally coherent sequences. At the heart of our model is a novel integrated 4D world generation framework. Specifically, we employ latent diffusion models to generate the 3D scene, combine it with dynamic actors to form the underlying 4D world, and subsequently produce realistic sensory observations within this virtual environment. Our experiments indicate that our approach outperforms competing algorithms in realism, temporal coherency, and layout consistency.

|**2024-04-03**|**HENet: Hybrid Encoding for End-to-end Multi-task 3D Perception from Multi-view Cameras**|Three-dimensional perception from multi-view cameras is a crucial component in autonomous driving systems, which involves multiple tasks like 3D object detection and bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. To improve perception precision, large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs have been adopted in recent 3D perception models, bringing remarkable performance gains. However, these techniques are often incompatible in training and inference scenarios due to computational resource constraints. Besides, modern autonomous driving systems prefer to adopt an end-to-end framework for multi-task 3D perception, which can simplify the overall system architecture and reduce the implementation complexity. However, conflict between tasks often arises when optimizing multiple tasks jointly within an end-to-end 3D perception model. To alleviate these issues, we present an end-to-end framework named HENet for multi-task 3D perception in this paper. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network, using a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small image encoder for long-term temporal frames. Then, we introduce a temporal feature integration module based on the attention mechanism to fuse the features of different frames extracted by the two aforementioned hybrid image encoders. Finally, according to the characteristics of each perception task, we utilize BEV features of different grid sizes, independent BEV encoders, and task decoders for different tasks. Experimental results show that HENet achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, including 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation.

|**2024-04-03**|**Optimizing traffic signs and lights visibility for the teleoperation of autonomous vehicles through ROI compression**|Autonomous vehicles are a promising solution to traffic congestion, air pollution, accidents, and wasted time and resources. However, remote driver intervention may be necessary for extreme situations to ensure safe roadside parking or complete remote takeover. In such cases, high-quality real-time video streaming is crucial for practical remote driving. In a preliminary study, we already presented a region of interest (ROI) HEVC data compression where the image was segmented into two categories of ROI and background, allocating more bandwidth to the ROI, yielding an improvement in the visibility of the classes that essential for driving while transmitting the background with lesser quality. However, migrating bandwidth to the large ROI portion of the image doesn't substantially improve the quality of traffic signs and lights. This work categorized the ROIs into either background, weak ROI, or strong ROI. The simulation-based approach uses a photo-realistic driving scenario database created with the Cognata self-driving car simulation platform. We use semantic segmentation to categorize the compression quality of a Coding Tree Unit (CTU) according to each pixel class. A background CTU can contain only sky, trees, vegetation, or building classes. Essentials for remote driving include significant classes such as roads, road marks, cars, and pedestrians. And most importantly, traffic signs and traffic lights. We apply thresholds to decide if the number of pixels in a CTU of a particular category is enough to declare it as belonging to the strong or weak ROI. Then, we allocate the bandwidth according to the CTU categories. Our results show that the perceptual quality of traffic signs, especially textual signs and traffic lights, improves significantly by up to 5.5 dB compared to the only background and foreground partition, while the weak ROI classes at least retain their original quality. et.al.|[2404.02481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02481)|null|

|**2024-04-03**|**TCLC-GS: Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting for Surrounding Autonomous Driving Scenes**|Most 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods for urban scenes initialize 3D Gaussians directly with 3D LiDAR points, which not only underutilizes LiDAR data capabilities but also overlooks the potential advantages of fusing LiDAR with camera data. In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios. et.al.|[2404.02410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02410)|null|

Existing motion prediction techniques primarily focus on predicting the future trajectory of each agent in the scene individually, utilizing its past trajectory data. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end neural network methodology designed to predict the future behaviors of all dynamic objects in the environment. This approach leverages the occupancy map and the scene's motion flow. We are investigatin various alternatives for constructing a deep encoder-decoder model called OFMPNet. This model uses a sequence of bird's-eye-view road images, occupancy grid, and prior motion flow as input data. The encoder of the model can incorporate transformer, attention-based, or convolutional units. The decoder considers the use of both convolutional modules and recurrent blocks. Additionally, we propose a novel time-weighted motion flow loss, whose application has shown a substantial decrease in end-point error.

|**2024-04-02**|**OOSTraj: Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction With Vision-Positioning Denoising**|Trajectory prediction is fundamental in computer vision and autonomous driving, particularly for understanding pedestrian behavior and enabling proactive decision-making. Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments.

To leverage the efficiency of task allocation, a heuristic filter evaluates potential task allocation based on STL robustness. Subsequently, an auctioning algorithm determines the definite allocation of specifications. Finally, a control strategy is synthesized for each agent-specification pair using tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), ensuring provable probabilistic satisfaction.

Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer" (WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems. et.al.|[2404.02082](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02082)|**[link](https://github.com/yangchen1997/wcdt)**|

|**2024-04-02**|**Improving Bird's Eye View Semantic Segmentation by Task Decomposition**|Semantic segmentation in bird's eye view (BEV) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. Previous methods usually follow an end-to-end pipeline, directly predicting the BEV segmentation map from monocular RGB inputs. However, the challenge arises when the RGB inputs and BEV targets from distinct perspectives, making the direct point-to-point predicting hard to optimize. In this paper, we decompose the original BEV segmentation task into two stages, namely BEV map reconstruction and RGB-BEV feature alignment. In the first stage, we train a BEV autoencoder to reconstruct the BEV segmentation maps given corrupted noisy latent representation, which urges the decoder to learn fundamental knowledge of typical BEV patterns. The second stage involves mapping RGB input images into the BEV latent space of the first stage, directly optimizing the correlations between the two views at the feature level. Our approach simplifies the complexity of combining perception and generation into distinct steps, equipping the model to handle intricate and challenging scenes effectively. Besides, we propose to transform the BEV segmentation map from the Cartesian to the polar coordinate system to establish the column-wise correspondence between RGB images and BEV maps. Moreover, our method requires neither multi-scale features nor camera intrinsic parameters for depth estimation and saves computational overhead. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Moreover, approximation techniques, such as quantization, have been introduced, which reduce the computational and storage requirements, thus enabling the integration of larger NNs into FPGA devices. On the other hand, FPGAs are sensitive to radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In this work, we perform an in-depth reliability analysis in an FPGA-based Binarized Fully Connected Neural Network (BNN) accelerator running a statistical fault injection campaign. The BNN benchmark has been produced by FINN, an open-source framework that provides an end-to-end flow from abstract level to design, making it easy to design customized FPGA NN accelerators, while it also supports various approximation techniques. The campaign includes the injection of faults in the configuration memory of a state-of-the-art Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA running the BNN, as well an exhaustive fault injection in the user flip flops. We have analyzed the fault injection results characterizing the SEU vulnerability of the circuit per network layer, per clock cycle, and register. In general, the results show that the BNNs are inherently resilient to soft errors, since a low portion of SEUs in the configuration memory and the flip flops, cause system crashes or misclassification errors. et.al.|[2404.01757](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01757)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**Exploring Latent Pathways: Enhancing the Interpretability of Autonomous Driving with a Variational Autoencoder**|Autonomous driving presents a complex challenge, which is usually addressed with artificial intelligence models that are end-to-end or modular in nature. Within the landscape of modular approaches, a bio-inspired neural circuit policy model has emerged as an innovative control module, offering a compact and inherently interpretable system to infer a steering wheel command from abstract visual features. Here, we take a leap forward by integrating a variational autoencoder with the neural circuit policy controller, forming a solution that directly generates steering commands from input camera images. By substituting the traditional convolutional neural network approach to feature extraction with a variational autoencoder, we enhance the system's interpretability, enabling a more transparent and understandable decision-making process.   In addition to the architectural shift toward a variational autoencoder, this study introduces the automatic latent perturbation tool, a novel contribution designed to probe and elucidate the latent features within the variational autoencoder. The automatic latent perturbation tool automates the interpretability process, offering granular insights into how specific latent variables influence the overall model's behavior. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate the interpretative power of the variational autoencoder-neural circuit policy model and the utility of the automatic latent perturbation tool in making the inner workings of autonomous driving systems more transparent. et.al.|[2404.01750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01750)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**Boosting Visual Recognition for Autonomous Driving in Real-world Degradations with Deep Channel Prior**|The environmental perception of autonomous vehicles in normal conditions have achieved considerable success in the past decade. However, various unfavourable conditions such as fog, low-light, and motion blur will degrade image quality and pose tremendous threats to the safety of autonomous driving. That is, when applied to degraded images, state-of-the-art visual models often suffer performance decline due to the feature content loss and artifact interference caused by statistical and structural properties disruption of captured images. To address this problem, this work proposes a novel Deep Channel Prior (DCP) for degraded visual recognition. Specifically, we observe that, in the deep representation space of pre-trained models, the channel correlations of degraded features with the same degradation type have uniform distribution even if they have different content and semantics, which can facilitate the mapping relationship learning between degraded and clear representations in high-sparsity feature space. Based on this, a novel plug-and-play Unsupervised Feature Enhancement Module (UFEM) is proposed to achieve unsupervised feature correction, where the multi-adversarial mechanism is introduced in the first stage of UFEM to achieve the latent content restoration and artifact removal in high-sparsity feature space. Then, the generated features are transferred to the second stage for global correlation modulation under the guidance of DCP to obtain high-quality and recognition-friendly features. Evaluations of three tasks and eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can comprehensively improve the performance of pre-trained models in real degradation conditions.

|**2024-04-02**|**Learning Temporal Cues by Predicting Objects Move for Multi-camera 3D Object Detection**|In autonomous driving and robotics, there is a growing interest in utilizing short-term historical data to enhance multi-camera 3D object detection, leveraging the continuous and correlated nature of input video streams. Recent work has focused on spatially aligning BEV-based features over timesteps. However, this is often limited as its gain does not scale well with long-term past observations. To address this, we advocate for supervising a model to predict objects' poses given past observations, thus explicitly guiding to learn objects' temporal cues. To this end, we propose a model called DAP (Detection After Prediction), consisting of a two-branch network: (i) a branch responsible for forecasting the current objects' poses given past observations and (ii) another branch that detects objects based on the current and past observations. The features predicting the current objects from branch (i) is fused into branch (ii) to transfer predictive knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments with the large-scale nuScenes datasets, and we observe that utilizing such predictive information significantly improves the overall detection performance.

|**2024-04-02**|**Are Doppler Velocity Measurements Useful for Spinning Radar Odometry?**|Spinning, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar has been gaining popularity for autonomous vehicle navigation. The spinning radar is chosen over the more classic automotive `fixed' radar as it is able to capture the full 360 degree field of view without requiring multiple sensors and extensive calibration. However, commercially available spinning radar systems have not previously had the ability to extract radial velocities due to the lack of repeated measurements in the same direction and fundamental hardware setup. A new firmware upgrade now makes it possible to alternate the modulation of the radar signal between azimuths. In this paper, we first present a way to use this alternating modulation to extract radial Doppler velocity measurements from single raw radar intensity scans. We then incorporate these measurements in two different modern odometry pipelines and evaluate them in progressively challenging autonomous driving environments. We show that using Doppler velocity measurements enables our odometry to continue functioning at state-of-the-art even in severely geometrically degenerate environments. et.al.|[2404.01537](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01537)|null|

The challenges arise due to the rise of new services, such as HD video streaming, IoT, autonomous driving, etc., and the exponential growth of network traffic. In this context, 5G and B5G networks have been evolving to accommodate a wide range of applications and use cases. Additionally, this evolution brings new features, like the ability to create multiple end-to-end isolated virtual networks using network slicing. Nevertheless, to ensure the quality of service, operators must maintain and optimize their networks in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the slice service-level agreements (SLAs).   In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model used to estimate throughput in 5G and B5G networks with end-to-end (E2E) network slices. Then, we combine the predicted throughput with the current network state to derive an estimate of other network KPIs, which can be used to further improve service assurance.

However, these estimations are coarse and are subjective to their "world understanding" which may generate sub-optimal decisions due to perception errors. In this paper, we introduce LeGo-Drive, which aims to address this issue by estimating a goal location based on the given language command as an intermediate representation in an end-to-end setting. The estimated goal might fall in a non-desirable region, like on top of a car for a parking-like command, leading to inadequate planning. Hence, we propose to train the architecture in an end-to-end manner, resulting in iterative refinement of both the goal and the trajectory collectively. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments conducted in diverse simulated environments. We report significant improvements in standard autonomous driving metrics, with a goal reaching Success Rate of 81%. We further showcase the versatility of LeGo-Drive across different driving scenarios and linguistic inputs, underscoring its potential for practical deployment in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. et.al.|[2403.20116](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20116)|null|

The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views. et.al.|[2403.20079](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20079)|null|

However, the previous 3DGS-based methods have limitations in urban scenes due to reliance on initial Structure-from-Motion(SfM) points and difficulties in rendering distant, sky and low-texture areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid optimization method named HO-Gaussian, which combines a grid-based volume with the 3DGS pipeline. HO-Gaussian eliminates the dependency on SfM point initialization, allowing for rendering of urban scenes, and incorporates the Point Densitification to enhance rendering quality in problematic regions during training. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian Direction Encoding as an alternative for spherical harmonics in the rendering pipeline, which enables view-dependent color representation. To account for multi-camera systems, we introduce neural warping to enhance object consistency across different cameras. Experimental results on widely used autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that HO-Gaussian achieves photo-realistic rendering in real-time on multi-camera urban datasets. et.al.|[2403.20032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20032)|null|
|**2024-03-29**|**PLoc: A New Evaluation Criterion Based on Physical Location for Autonomous Driving Datasets**|Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention as a key research area within artificial intelligence. In the context of autonomous driving scenarios, the varying physical locations of objects correspond to different levels of danger. However, conventional evaluation criteria for automatic driving object detection often overlook the crucial aspect of an object's physical location, leading to evaluation results that may not accurately reflect the genuine threat posed by the object to the autonomous driving vehicle. To enhance the safety of autonomous driving, this paper introduces a novel evaluation criterion based on physical location information, termed PLoc. This criterion transcends the limitations of traditional criteria by acknowledging that the physical location of pedestrians in autonomous driving scenarios can provide valuable safety-related information. Furthermore, this paper presents a newly re-annotated dataset (ApolloScape-R) derived from ApolloScape. ApolloScape-R involves the relabeling of pedestrians based on the significance of their physical location. The dataset is utilized to assess the performance of various object detection models under the proposed PLoc criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy of all object detection models in identifying a person situated in the travel lane of an autonomous vehicle is lower than that for a person on a sidewalk.

However, current approaches to these systems use expensive large language model (LLM) backbones and image encoders, making such systems unsuitable for real-time autonomous driving systems where tight memory constraints exist and fast inference time is necessary. To address these previous issues, we develop EM-VLM4AD, an efficient, lightweight, multi-frame vision language model which performs Visual Question Answering for autonomous driving.

|**2024-03-28**|**ENet-21: An Optimized light CNN Structure for Lane Detection**|Lane detection for autonomous vehicles is an important concept, yet it is a challenging issue of driver assistance systems in modern vehicles. The emergence of deep learning leads to significant progress in self-driving cars. Conventional deep learning-based methods handle lane detection problems as a binary segmentation task and determine whether a pixel belongs to a line. These methods rely on the assumption of a fixed number of lanes, which does not always work. This study aims to develop an optimal structure for the lane detection problem, offering a promising solution for driver assistance features in modern vehicles by utilizing a machine learning method consisting of binary segmentation and Affinity Fields that can manage varying numbers of lanes and lane change scenarios. In this approach, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is selected as a feature extractor, and the final output is obtained through clustering of the semantic segmentation and Affinity Field outputs.

|**2024-03-28**|**Human-compatible driving partners through data-regularized self-play reinforcement learning**|A central challenge for autonomous vehicles is coordinating with humans. Therefore, incorporating realistic human agents is essential for scalable training and evaluation of autonomous driving systems in simulation. Simulation agents are typically developed by imitating large-scale, high-quality datasets of human driving. However, pure imitation learning agents empirically have high collision rates when executed in a multi-agent closed-loop setting. To build agents that are realistic and effective in closed-loop settings, we propose Human-Regularized PPO (HR-PPO), a multi-agent algorithm where agents are trained through self-play with a small penalty for deviating from a human reference policy. In contrast to prior work, our approach is RL-first and only uses 30 minutes of imperfect human demonstrations. We evaluate agents in a large set of multi-agent traffic scenes. Results show our HR-PPO agents are highly effective in achieving goals, with a success rate of 93%, an off-road rate of 3.5%, and a collision rate of 3%. At the same time, the agents drive in a human-like manner, as measured by their similarity to existing human driving logs. We also find that HR-PPO agents show considerable improvements on proxy measures for coordination with human driving, particularly in highly interactive scenarios. We open-source our code and trained agents at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/nocturne_lab and provide demonstrations of agent behaviors at https://sites.google.com/view/driving-partners. et.al.|[2403.19648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19648)|**[link](https://github.com/emerge-lab/nocturne_lab)**|
|**2024-03-28**|**Learning Sampling Distribution and Safety Filter for Autonomous Driving with VQ-VAE and Differentiable Optimization**|Sampling trajectories from a distribution followed by ranking them based on a specified cost function is a common approach in autonomous driving. Typically, the sampling distribution is hand-crafted (e.g a Gaussian, or a grid). Recently, there have been efforts towards learning the sampling distribution through generative models such as Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). However, these approaches fail to capture the multi-modality of the driving behaviour due to the Gaussian latent prior of the CVAE. Thus, in this paper, we re-imagine the distribution learning through vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), whose discrete latent-space is well equipped to capture multi-modal sampling distribution. The VQ-VAE is trained with demonstration data of optimal trajectories. We further propose a differentiable optimization based safety filter to minimally correct the VQVAE sampled trajectories to ensure collision avoidance. We use backpropagation through the optimization layers in a self-supervised learning set-up to learn good initialization and optimal parameters of the safety filter. We perform extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art CVAE-based baseline in dense and aggressive traffic scenarios and show a reduction of up to 12 times in collision-rate while being competitive in driving speeds. et.al.|[2403.19461](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19461)|**[link](https://github.com/cisimon7/vqoptmain)**|

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are proposed to ensure the safety of the control system by constructing safety filters or synthesizing control inputs. However, the safety guarantee and performance of safe controllers rely on the construction of valid CBFs. Inspired by universal approximatability, CBFs are represented by neural networks, known as neural CBFs (NCBFs). This paper presents an algorithm for synthesizing formally verified continuous-time neural Control Barrier Functions in stochastic environments in a single step. The proposed training process ensures efficacy across the entire state space with only a finite number of data points by constructing a sample-based learning framework for Stochastic Neural CBFs (SNCBFs). Our methodology eliminates the need for post hoc verification by enforcing Lipschitz bounds on the neural network, its Jacobian, and Hessian terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies on the inverted pendulum system and obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving, showcasing larger safe regions compared to baseline methods. et.al.|[2403.19332](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19332)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**CRKD: Enhanced Camera-Radar Object Detection with Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation**|In the field of 3D object detection for autonomous driving, LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion is the top-performing sensor configuration. Still, LiDAR is relatively high cost, which hinders adoption of this technology for consumer automobiles. Alternatively, camera and radar are commonly deployed on vehicles already on the road today, but performance of Camera-Radar (CR) fusion falls behind LC fusion. In this work, we propose Camera-Radar Knowledge Distillation (CRKD) to bridge the performance gap between LC and CR detectors with a novel cross-modality KD framework. We use the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation as the shared feature space to enable effective knowledge distillation. To accommodate the unique cross-modality KD path, we propose four distillation losses to help the student learn crucial features from the teacher model. We present extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CRKD framework.

|**2024-03-28**|**GraphAD: Interaction Scene Graph for End-to-end Autonomous Driving**|Modeling complicated interactions among the ego-vehicle, road agents, and map elements has been a crucial part for safety-critical autonomous driving. Previous works on end-to-end autonomous driving rely on the attention mechanism for handling heterogeneous interactions, which fails to capture the geometric priors and is also computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the Interaction Scene Graph (ISG) as a unified method to model the interactions among the ego-vehicle, road agents, and map elements. With the representation of the ISG, the driving agents aggregate essential information from the most influential elements, including the road agents with potential collisions and the map elements to follow. Since a mass of unnecessary interactions are omitted, the more efficient scene-graph-based framework is able to focus on indispensable connections and leads to better performance. We evaluate the proposed method for end-to-end autonomous driving on the nuScenes dataset. Compared with strong baselines, our method significantly outperforms in the full-stack driving tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning.

By simulating challenging conditions that mimic the real-world situations, our framework aims to rigorously test entire system's safety and reliability.

Consequently, remarkable solutions exist to autonomous systems' environmental perception and control. Nevertheless, proof of safety remains an open challenge preventing such machinery from being introduced to markets and deployed in real world. Traditional approaches for safety assurance of autonomously driving vehicles often lead to underperformance due to conservative safety assumptions that cannot handle the overall complexity. Besides, the more sophisticated safety systems rely on the vehicle's perception systems. However, perception is often unreliable due to uncertainties resulting from disturbances or the lack of context incorporation for data interpretation. Accordingly, this paper illustrates the potential of a modular, self-adaptive autonomy framework with integrated dynamic risk management to overcome the abovementioned drawbacks. et.al.|[2403.19006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19006)|null|

|**2024-03-27**|**LORD: Large Models based Opposite Reward Design for Autonomous Driving**|Reinforcement learning (RL) based autonomous driving has emerged as a promising alternative to data-driven imitation learning approaches. However, crafting effective reward functions for RL poses challenges due to the complexity of defining and quantifying good driving behaviors across diverse scenarios. Recently, large pretrained models have gained significant attention as zero-shot reward models for tasks specified with desired linguistic goals. However, the desired linguistic goals for autonomous driving such as "drive safely" are ambiguous and incomprehensible by pretrained models. On the other hand, undesired linguistic goals like "collision" are more concrete and tractable. In this work, we introduce LORD, a novel large models based opposite reward design through undesired linguistic goals to enable the efficient use of large pretrained models as zero-shot reward models. Through extensive experiments, our proposed framework shows its efficiency in leveraging the power of large pretrained models for achieving safe and enhanced autonomous driving. Moreover, the proposed approach shows improved generalization capabilities as it outperforms counterpart methods across diverse and challenging driving scenarios. et.al.|[2403.18965](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18965)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**Sampling-Based Motion Planning with Online Racing Line Generation for Autonomous Driving on Three-Dimensional Race Tracks**|Existing approaches to trajectory planning for autonomous racing employ sampling-based methods, generating numerous jerk-optimal trajectories and selecting the most favorable feasible trajectory based on a cost function penalizing deviations from an offline-calculated racing line. While successful on oval tracks, these methods face limitations on complex circuits due to the simplistic geometry of jerk-optimal edges failing to capture the complexity of the racing line. Additionally, they only consider two-dimensional tracks, potentially neglecting or surpassing the actual dynamic potential. In this paper, we present a sampling-based local trajectory planning approach for autonomous racing that can maintain the lap time of the racing line even on complex race tracks and consider the race track's three-dimensional effects. In simulative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves lower lap times and improved utilization of dynamic limits compared to existing approaches. We also investigate the impact of online racing line generation, in which the time-optimal solution is planned from the current vehicle state for a limited spatial horizon, in contrast to a closed racing line calculated offline. We show that combining the sampling-based planner with the online racing line generation can significantly reduce lap times in multi-vehicle scenarios. et.al.|[2403.18643](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18643)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**Long and Short-Term Constraints Driven Safe Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving**|Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in decision-making tasks, but it cannot guarantee the agent's safety in the training process due to the requirements of interaction with the environment, which seriously limits its industrial applications such as autonomous driving. Safe RL methods are developed to handle this issue by constraining the expected safety violation costs as a training objective, but they still permit unsafe state occurrence, which is unacceptable in autonomous driving tasks. Moreover, these methods are difficult to achieve a balance between the cost and return expectations, which leads to learning performance degradation for the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the long and short-term constraints (LSTC) for safe RL. The short-term constraint aims to guarantee the short-term state safety that the vehicle explores, while the long-term constraint ensures the overall safety of the vehicle throughout the decision-making process. In addition, we develop a safe RL method with dual-constraint optimization based on the Lagrange multiplier to optimize the training process for end-to-end autonomous driving. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the MetaDrive simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher safety in continuous state and action tasks, and exhibits higher exploration performance in long-distance decision-making tasks compared with state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2403.18209](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18209)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**Road Obstacle Detection based on Unknown Objectness Scores**|The detection of unknown traffic obstacles is vital to ensure safe autonomous driving. The standard object-detection methods cannot identify unknown objects that are not included under predefined categories. This is because object-detection methods are trained to assign a background label to pixels corresponding to the presence of unknown objects. To address this problem, the pixel-wise anomaly-detection approach has attracted increased research attention. Anomaly-detection techniques, such as uncertainty estimation and perceptual difference from reconstructed images, make it possible to identify pixels of unknown objects as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, when applied to images with many unknowns and complex components, such as driving scenes, these methods often exhibit unstable performance. The purpose of this study is to achieve stable performance for detecting unknown objects by incorporating the object-detection fashions into the pixel-wise anomaly detection methods. To achieve this goal, we adopt a semantic-segmentation network with a sigmoid head that simultaneously provides pixel-wise anomaly scores and objectness scores. Our experimental results show that the objectness scores play an important role in improving the detection performance. Based on these results, we propose a novel anomaly score by integrating these two scores, which we term as unknown objectness score. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to the publicly available datasets. et.al.|[2403.18207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18207)|null|

This work presents Low-Latency neural codec for Stereo video Streaming (LLSS), a novel parallel stereo video coding method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo video streaming. Instead of using a sequential cross-view motion compensation like existing methods, LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to directly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively with a joint cross-view prior model for entropy coding. Thanks to this design, LLSS processes left and right views in parallel, minimizing latency; all while substantially improving R-D performance compared to both existing neural and conventional codecs. et.al.|[2403.17879](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17879)|null|

This paper introduces a state-of-the-art LiDAR-based navigation system that can achieve over-canopy autonomous navigation in row-crop fields, even when the canopy fully blocks the interrow spacing. Our crop row detection algorithm can detect crop rows across diverse scenarios, encompassing various crop types, growth stages, weed presence, and discontinuities within the crop rows. Without utilizing the global localization of the robot, our navigation system can perform autonomous navigation in these challenging scenarios, detect the end of the crop rows, and navigate to the next crop row autonomously, providing a crop-agnostic approach to navigate the whole row-crop field. This navigation system has undergone tests in various simulated agricultural fields, achieving an average of $2.98cm$ autonomous driving accuracy without human intervention on the custom Amiga robot.

|**2024-03-27**|**Imitating Cost-Constrained Behaviors in Reinforcement Learning**|Complex planning and scheduling problems have long been solved using various optimization or heuristic approaches. In recent years, imitation learning that aims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable alternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning is designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the behavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation primarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the vehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is governed not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For instance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on the route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the fuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation learning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model but are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide multiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory cost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to find a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint violation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient. We empirically show that leading imitation learning approaches imitate cost-constrained behaviors poorly and our meta-gradient-based approach achieves the best performance. et.al.|[2403.17456](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17456)|null|

Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction. RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features, with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore, RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21~28 FPS.

|**2024-03-25**|**ProIn: Learning to Predict Trajectory Based on Progressive Interactions for Autonomous Driving**|Accurate motion prediction of pedestrians, cyclists, and other surrounding vehicles (all called agents) is very important for autonomous driving. Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks. et.al.|[2403.16374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16374)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**Impact of Video Compression Artifacts on Fisheye Camera Visual Perception Tasks**|Autonomous driving systems require extensive data collection schemes to cover the diverse scenarios needed for building a robust and safe system. The data volumes are in the order of Exabytes and have to be stored for a long period of time (i.e., more than 10 years of the vehicle's life cycle). Lossless compression doesn't provide sufficient compression ratios, hence, lossy video compression has been explored. It is essential to prove that lossy video compression artifacts do not impact the performance of the perception algorithms. However, there is limited work in this area to provide a solid conclusion. In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which have high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts. Fisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection task. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard video compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that the achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and temporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware zonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In addition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of the latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs for the application to fisheye imagery. et.al.|[2403.16338](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16338)|null|
|**2024-03-24**|**Engineering Safety Requirements for Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models**|Changes and updates in the requirement artifacts, which can be frequent in the automotive domain, are a challenge for SafetyOps. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their impressive natural language understanding and generating capabilities, can play a key role in automatically refining and decomposing requirements after each update. In this study, we propose a prototype of a pipeline of prompts and LLMs that receives an item definition and outputs solutions in the form of safety requirements. This pipeline also performs a review of the requirement dataset and identifies redundant or contradictory requirements. We first identified the necessary characteristics for performing HARA and then defined tests to assess an LLM's capability in meeting these criteria. We used design science with multiple iterations and let experts from different companies evaluate each cycle quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, the prototype was implemented at a case company and the responsible team evaluated its efficiency. et.al.|[2403.16289](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16289)|null|
|**2024-03-24**|**Interference Management for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: A Survey**|Emerging applications such as autonomous driving and Internet of things (IoT) services put forward the demand for simutaneous sensing and communication functions in the same system. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the potential to meet the demands of ubiquitous communication and high-precision sensing due to the advantages of spectrum and hardware resource sharing, as well as the mutual enhancement of sensing and communication. However, ISAC system faces severe interference requiring effective interference suppression, avoidance, and exploitation techniques. This article provides a comprehensive survey on the interference management techniques in ISAC systems, involving network architecture, system design, signal processing, and resource allocation. We first review the channel modeling and performance metrics of the ISAC system. Then, the methods for managing self-interference (SI), mutual interference (MI), and clutter in a single base station (BS) system are summarized, including interference suppression, interference avoidance and interference exploitation methods. Furthermore, cooperative interference management methods are studied to address the cross-link interference (CLI) in a coordinated multipoint ISAC (CoMP-ISAC) system. Finally, future trends are revealed. This article may provide a reference for the study of interference management in ISAC systems. et.al.|[2403.16189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16189)|null|
|**2024-03-24**|**Self-Supervised Multi-Frame Neural Scene Flow**|Neural Scene Flow Prior (NSFP) and Fast Neural Scene Flow (FNSF) have shown remarkable adaptability in the context of large out-of-distribution autonomous driving. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their astonishing generalization capabilities remain unclear. Our research addresses this gap by examining the generalization capabilities of NSFP through the lens of uniform stability, revealing that its performance is inversely proportional to the number of input point clouds. This finding sheds light on NSFP's effectiveness in handling large-scale point cloud scene flow estimation tasks. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we further explore the improvement of scene flow estimation by leveraging historical point clouds across multiple frames, which inherently increases the number of point clouds. Consequently, we propose a simple and effective method for multi-frame point cloud scene flow estimation, along with a theoretical evaluation of its generalization abilities. Our analysis confirms that the proposed method maintains a limited generalization error, suggesting that adding multiple frames to the scene flow optimization process does not detract from its generalizability. Extensive experimental results on large-scale autonomous driving Waymo Open and Argoverse lidar datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. et.al.|[2403.16116](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16116)|null|
|**2024-03-24**|**Are NeRFs ready for autonomous driving? Towards closing the real-to-simulation gap**|Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as promising tools for advancing autonomous driving (AD) research, offering scalable closed-loop simulation and data augmentation capabilities. However, to trust the results achieved in simulation, one needs to ensure that AD systems perceive real and rendered data in the same way. Although the performance of rendering methods is increasing, many scenarios will remain inherently challenging to reconstruct faithfully. To this end, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the real-to-simulated data gap. Rather than solely focusing on improving rendering fidelity, we explore simple yet effective methods to enhance perception model robustness to NeRF artifacts without compromising performance on real data. Moreover, we conduct the first large-scale investigation into the real-to-simulated data gap in an AD setting using a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Specifically, we evaluate object detectors and an online mapping model on real and simulated data, and study the effects of different pre-training strategies. Our results show notable improvements in model robustness to simulated data, even improving real-world performance in some cases. Last, we delve into the correlation between the real-to-simulated gap and image reconstruction metrics, identifying FID and LPIPS as strong indicators. et.al.|[2403.16092](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16092)|null|
|**2024-03-23**|**iA $^*$: Imperative Learning-based A$^*$ Search for Pathfinding**|The pathfinding problem, which aims to identify a collision-free path between two points, is crucial for many applications, such as robot navigation and autonomous driving. Classic methods, such as A$^*$ search, perform well on small-scale maps but face difficulties scaling up. Conversely, data-driven approaches can improve pathfinding efficiency but require extensive data labeling and lack theoretical guarantees, making it challenging for practical applications. To combine the strengths of the two methods, we utilize the imperative learning (IL) strategy and propose a novel self-supervised pathfinding framework, termed imperative learning-based A$^*$ (iA$^*$). Specifically, iA$^*$ is a bilevel optimization process where the lower-level optimization is dedicated to finding the optimal path by a differentiable A$^*$ search module, and the upper-level optimization narrows down the search space to improve efficiency via setting suitable initial values from a data-driven model. Besides, the model within the upper-level optimization is a fully convolutional network, trained by the calculated loss in the lower-level optimization. Thus, the framework avoids extensive data labeling and can be applied in diverse environments. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that iA$^*$ surpasses both classical and data-driven methods in pathfinding efficiency and shows superior robustness among different tasks, validated with public datasets and simulation environments. et.al.|[2403.15870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15870)|null|
|**2024-03-23**|**Spatio-Temporal Bi-directional Cross-frame Memory for Distractor Filtering Point Cloud Single Object Tracking**|3D single object tracking within LIDAR point clouds is a pivotal task in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2403.15831](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15831)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**Augmented Reality based Simulated Data (ARSim) with multi-view consistency for AV perception networks**|Detecting a diverse range of objects under various driving scenarios is essential for the effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the real-world data collected often lacks the necessary diversity presenting a long-tail distribution. Although synthetic data has been utilized to overcome this issue by generating virtual scenes, it faces hurdles such as a significant domain gap and the substantial efforts required from 3D artists to create realistic environments. To overcome these challenges, we present ARSim, a fully automated, comprehensive, modular framework designed to enhance real multi-view image data with 3D synthetic objects of interest. The proposed method integrates domain adaptation and randomization strategies to address covariate shift between real and simulated data by inferring essential domain attributes from real data and employing simulation-based randomization for other attributes. We construct a simplified virtual scene using real data and strategically place 3D synthetic assets within it. Illumination is achieved by estimating light distribution from multiple images capturing the surroundings of the vehicle. Camera parameters from real data are employed to render synthetic assets in each frame. The resulting augmented multi-view consistent dataset is used to train a multi-camera perception network for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results on various AV perception tasks demonstrate the superior performance of networks trained on the augmented dataset. et.al.|[2403.15370](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15370)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**CR3DT: Camera-RADAR Fusion for 3D Detection and Tracking**|Accurate detection and tracking of surrounding objects is essential to enable self-driving vehicles. While Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have set the benchmark for high performance, the appeal of camera-only solutions lies in their cost-effectiveness. Notably, despite the prevalent use of Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) sensors in automotive systems, their potential in 3D detection and tracking has been largely disregarded due to data sparsity and measurement noise. As a recent development, the combination of RADARs and cameras is emerging as a promising solution. This paper presents Camera-RADAR 3D Detection and Tracking (CR3DT), a camera-RADAR fusion model for 3D object detection, and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). Building upon the foundations of the State-of-the-Art (SotA) camera-only BEVDet architecture, CR3DT demonstrates substantial improvements in both detection and tracking capabilities, by incorporating the spatial and velocity information of the RADAR sensor. Experimental results demonstrate an absolute improvement in detection performance of 5.3% in mean Average Precision (mAP) and a 14.9% increase in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) on the nuScenes dataset when leveraging both modalities. CR3DT bridges the gap between high-performance and cost-effective perception systems in autonomous driving, by capitalizing on the ubiquitous presence of RADAR in automotive applications. et.al.|[2403.15313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15313)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**IS-Fusion: Instance-Scene Collaborative Fusion for Multimodal 3D Object Detection**|Bird's eye view (BEV) representation has emerged as a dominant solution for describing 3D space in autonomous driving scenarios. However, objects in the BEV representation typically exhibit small sizes, and the associated point cloud context is inherently sparse, which leads to great challenges for reliable 3D perception. In this paper, we propose IS-Fusion, an innovative multimodal fusion framework that jointly captures the Instance- and Scene-level contextual information. IS-Fusion essentially differs from existing approaches that only focus on the BEV scene-level fusion by explicitly incorporating instance-level multimodal information, thus facilitating the instance-centric tasks like 3D object detection. It comprises a Hierarchical Scene Fusion (HSF) module and an Instance-Guided Fusion (IGF) module. HSF applies Point-to-Grid and Grid-to-Region transformers to capture the multimodal scene context at different granularities. IGF mines instance candidates, explores their relationships, and aggregates the local multimodal context for each instance. These instances then serve as guidance to enhance the scene feature and yield an instance-aware BEV representation. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, IS-Fusion outperforms all the published multimodal works to date.

This paper proposes DriViDOC: a model for Driving from Vision through Differentiable Optimal Control, and its application to learn personalized autonomous driving controllers from human demonstrations. DriViDOC combines the automatic inference of relevant features from camera frames with the properties of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), such as constraint satisfaction. Our approach leverages the differentiability of parametric NMPC, allowing for end-to-end learning of the driving model from images to control. The model is trained on an offline dataset comprising various driving styles collected on a motion-base driving simulator. During online testing, the model demonstrates successful imitation of different driving styles, and the interpreted NMPC parameters provide insights into the achievement of specific driving behaviors. Our experimental results show that DriViDOC outperforms other methods involving NMPC and neural networks, exhibiting an average improvement of 20% in imitation scores. et.al.|[2403.15102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15102)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**Tri-Perspective View Decomposition for Geometry-Aware Depth Completion**|Depth completion is a vital task for autonomous driving, as it involves reconstructing the precise 3D geometry of a scene from sparse and noisy depth measurements. However, most existing methods either rely only on 2D depth representations or directly incorporate raw 3D point clouds for compensation, which are still insufficient to capture the fine-grained 3D geometry of the scene. To address this challenge, we introduce Tri-Perspective view Decomposition (TPVD), a novel framework that can explicitly model 3D geometry. In particular, (1) TPVD ingeniously decomposes the original point cloud into three 2D views, one of which corresponds to the sparse depth input. (2) We design TPV Fusion to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D aggregation, where a Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC) is applied. (3) By adaptively choosing TPV affinitive neighbors, the newly proposed Geometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) further improves the geometric consistency. As a result, our TPVD outperforms existing methods on KITTI, NYUv2, and SUN RGBD. Furthermore, we build a novel depth completion dataset named TOFDC, which is acquired by the time-of-flight (TOF) sensor and the color camera on smartphones.

|**2024-03-22**|**Boundary-Aware Value Function Generation for Safe Stochastic Motion Planning**|Navigation safety is critical for many autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles in an urban environment. It requires an explicit consideration of boundary constraints that describe the borders of any infeasible, non-navigable, or unsafe regions. We propose a principled boundary-aware safe stochastic planning framework with promising results. Our method generates a value function that can strictly distinguish the state values between free (safe) and non-navigable (boundary) spaces in the continuous state, naturally leading to a safe boundary-aware policy. At the core of our solution lies a seamless integration of finite elements and kernel-based functions, where the finite elements allow us to characterize safety-critical states' borders accurately, and the kernel-based function speeds up computation for the non-safety-critical states. The proposed method was evaluated through extensive simulations and demonstrated safe navigation behaviors in mobile navigation tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can maneuver safely and efficiently in cluttered real-world environments using a ground vehicle with strong external disturbances, such as navigating on a slippery floor and against external human intervention. et.al.|[2403.14956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14956)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**Unifying Lane-Level Traffic Prediction from a Graph Structural Perspective: Benchmark and Baseline**|Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. This paper extensively analyzes and categorizes existing research in lane-level traffic prediction, establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction tasks, and introduces a simple baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. We have replicated codes not publicly available in existing studies and, based on this, thoroughly and fairly assessed various models in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability, providing insights for practical applications.

|**2024-03-21**|**SurroundSDF: Implicit 3D Scene Understanding Based on Signed Distance Field**|Vision-centric 3D environment understanding is both vital and challenging for autonomous driving systems. Recently, object-free methods have attracted considerable attention. Such methods perceive the world by predicting the semantics of discrete voxel grids but fail to construct continuous and accurate obstacle surfaces. To this end, in this paper, we propose SurroundSDF to implicitly predict the signed distance field (SDF) and semantic field for the continuous perception from surround images. Specifically, we introduce a query-based approach and utilize SDF constrained by the Eikonal formulation to accurately describe the surfaces of obstacles. Furthermore, considering the absence of precise SDF ground truth, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm for SDF, referred to as the Sandwich Eikonal formulation, which emphasizes applying correct and dense constraints on both sides of the surface, thereby enhancing the perceptual accuracy of the surface. Experiments suggest that our method achieves SOTA for both occupancy prediction and 3D scene reconstruction tasks on the nuScenes dataset. et.al.|[2403.14366](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14366)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**DaCapo: Accelerating Continuous Learning in Autonomous Systems for Video Analytics**|Deep neural network (DNN) video analytics is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and security robots. However, real-world deployment faces challenges due to their limited computational resources and battery power. To tackle these challenges, continuous learning exploits a lightweight "student" model at deployment (inference), leverages a larger "teacher" model for labeling sampled data (labeling), and continuously retrains the student model to adapt to changing scenarios (retraining). This paper highlights the limitations in state-of-the-art continuous learning systems: (1) they focus on computations for retraining, while overlooking the compute needs for inference and labeling, (2) they rely on power-hungry GPUs, unsuitable for battery-operated autonomous systems, and (3) they are located on a remote centralized server, intended for multi-tenant scenarios, again unsuitable for autonomous systems due to privacy, network availability, and latency concerns. We propose a hardware-algorithm co-designed solution for continuous learning, DaCapo, that enables autonomous systems to perform concurrent executions of inference, labeling, and training in a performant and energy-efficient manner. DaCapo comprises (1) a spatially-partitionable and precision-flexible accelerator enabling parallel execution of kernels on sub-accelerators at their respective precisions, and (2) a spatiotemporal resource allocation algorithm that strategically navigates the resource-accuracy tradeoff space, facilitating optimal decisions for resource allocation to achieve maximal accuracy. Our evaluation shows that DaCapo achieves 6.5% and 5.5% higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art GPU-based continuous learning systems, Ekya and EOMU, respectively, while consuming 254x less power. et.al.|[2403.14353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14353)|null|
|**2024-03-20**|**Reinforcement Learning for Online Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems: a Replication and Extension Study**|In a recent study, Reinforcement Learning (RL) used in combination with many-objective search, has been shown to outperform alternative techniques (random search and many-objective search) for online testing of Deep Neural Network-enabled systems. The empirical evaluation of these techniques was conducted on a state-of-the-art Autonomous Driving System (ADS). This work is a replication and extension of that empirical study. Our replication shows that RL does not outperform pure random test generation in a comparison conducted under the same settings of the original study, but with no confounding factor coming from the way collisions are measured. Our extension aims at eliminating some of the possible reasons for the poor performance of RL observed in our replication: (1) the presence of reward components providing contrasting or useless feedback to the RL agent; (2) the usage of an RL algorithm (Q-learning) which requires discretization of an intrinsically continuous state space. Results show that our new RL agent is able to converge to an effective policy that outperforms random testing. Results also highlight other possible improvements, which open to further investigations on how to best leverage RL for online ADS testing. et.al.|[2403.13729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13729)|null|
|**2024-03-20**|**Reward-Driven Automated Curriculum Learning for Interaction-Aware Self-Driving at Unsignalized Intersections**|In this work, we present a reward-driven automated curriculum reinforcement learning approach for interaction-aware self-driving at unsignalized intersections, taking into account the uncertainties associated with surrounding vehicles (SVs). These uncertainties encompass the uncertainty of SVs' driving intention and also the quantity of SVs. To deal with this problem, the curriculum set is specifically designed to accommodate a progressively increasing number of SVs. By implementing an automated curriculum selection mechanism, the importance weights are rationally allocated across various curricula, thereby facilitating improved sample efficiency and training outcomes. Furthermore, the reward function is meticulously designed to guide the agent towards effective policy exploration. Thus the proposed framework could proactively address the above uncertainties at unsignalized intersections by employing the automated curriculum learning technique that progressively increases task difficulty, and this ensures safe self-driving through effective interaction with SVs. Comparative experiments are conducted in $Highway\_Env$ , and the results indicate that our approach achieves the highest task success rate, attains strong robustness to initialization parameters of the curriculum selection module, and exhibits superior adaptability to diverse situational configurations at unsignalized intersections. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. et.al.|[2403.13674](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13674)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**AMP: Autoregressive Motion Prediction Revisited with Next Token Prediction for Autonomous Driving**|As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition. However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training MLPs compared to autoregressive networks.   In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible. However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units -words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed designs. et.al.|[2403.13331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13331)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Spatial and Temporal Consistency Regularizations**|The perception of motion behavior in a dynamic environment holds significant importance for autonomous driving systems, wherein class-agnostic motion prediction methods directly predict the motion of the entire point cloud. While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses, which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. et.al.|[2403.13261](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13261)|**[link](https://github.com/kwwcv/selfmotion)**|

However, due to the ambiguity in driving intentions and right-of-way issues, the lane merging process in autonomous driving remains deficient in terms of maintaining or ceding the right-of-way and attributing liability, which could result in protracted durations for merging and problems such as trajectory oscillation. Hence, we present a rule-compliance path planner (RCPP) for lane-merge scenarios, which initially employs the extended responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS) to elucidate the right-of-way, followed by the potential field-based sigmoid planner for path generation. In the simulation, we have validated the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm demonstrated superior performance over previous approaches in aspects such as merging time (Saved 72.3%), path length (reduced 53.4%), and eliminating the trajectory oscillation. et.al.|[2403.13251](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13251)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**M2DA: Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer Incorporating Driver Attention for Autonomous Driving**|End-to-end autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable progress. However, the extensive deployment of autonomous vehicles has yet to be realized, primarily due to 1) inefficient multi-modal environment perception: how to integrate data from multi-modal sensors more efficiently; 2) non-human-like scene understanding: how to effectively locate and predict critical risky agents in traffic scenarios like an experienced driver. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal fusion transformer incorporating Driver Attention (M2DA) for autonomous driving. To better fuse multi-modal data and achieve higher alignment between different modalities, a novel Lidar-Vision-Attention-based Fusion (LVAFusion) module is proposed. By incorporating driver attention, we empower the human-like scene understanding ability to autonomous vehicles to identify crucial areas within complex scenarios precisely and ensure safety.

However, a lack of interpretability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these cars are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Such drawback raises serious safety concerns from societal and legal perspectives. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to enable the safety of vehicular automation. However, the safety and explainability aspects of autonomous driving have generally been investigated disjointly by researchers in today's state of the art. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between these topics and seek to answer the following research question: When and how can explanations improve safety of autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and state-of-the-art explainability techniques in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we present three critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing self-driving safety. Finally, we describe our empirical investigation and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats with practical explainable AI methods on their role of assuring safety and transparency for vehicle autonomy. et.al.|[2403.12176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12176)|null|

A common approach enabling the ability to reason over visual data is Scene Graph Generation (SGG); however, many existing approaches assume undisturbed vision, i.e., the absence of real-world corruptions such as fog, snow, smoke, as well as non-uniform perturbations like sun glare or water drops. In this work, we propose a novel SGG benchmark containing procedurally generated weather corruptions and other transformations over the Visual Genome dataset. Further, we introduce a corresponding approach, Hierarchical Knowledge Enhanced Robust Scene Graph Generation (HiKER-SGG), providing a strong baseline for scene graph generation under such challenging setting. At its core, HiKER-SGG utilizes a hierarchical knowledge graph in order to refine its predictions from coarse initial estimates to detailed predictions. In our extensive experiments, we show that HiKER-SGG does not only demonstrate superior performance on corrupted images in a zero-shot manner, but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on uncorrupted SGG tasks.

|**2024-03-18**|**Informed Spectral Normalized Gaussian Processes for Trajectory Prediction**|Prior parameter distributions provide an elegant way to represent prior expert and world knowledge for informed learning. Previous work has shown that using such informative priors to regularize probabilistic deep learning (DL) models increases their performance and data-efficiency. However, commonly used sampling-based approximations for probabilistic DL models can be computationally expensive, requiring multiple inference passes and longer training times. Promising alternatives are compute-efficient last layer kernel approximations like spectral normalized Gaussian processes (SNGPs). We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method for SNGPs, which enables the use of informative priors that represent prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. Our proposal builds upon well-established methods and requires no rehearsal memory or parameter expansion. We apply our informed SNGP model to the trajectory prediction problem in autonomous driving by integrating prior drivability knowledge. On two public datasets, we investigate its performance under diminishing training data and across locations, and thereby demonstrate an increase in data-efficiency and robustness to location-transfers over non-informed and informed baselines. et.al.|[2403.11966](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11966)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**Reinforcement Learning with Latent State Inference for Autonomous On-ramp Merging under Observation Delay**|This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenging problem of autonomous on-ramp merging, where a self-driving vehicle needs to seamlessly integrate into a flow of vehicles on a multi-lane highway. We introduce the Lane-keeping, Lane-changing with Latent-state Inference and Safety Controller (L3IS) agent, designed to perform the on-ramp merging task safely without comprehensive knowledge about surrounding vehicles' intents or driving styles. We also present an augmentation of this agent called AL3IS that accounts for observation delays, allowing the agent to make more robust decisions in real-world environments with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delays. By modeling the unobservable aspects of the environment through latent states, such as other drivers' intents, our approach enhances the agent's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions, optimize merging maneuvers, and ensure safe interactions with other vehicles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulations generated from real traffic data and compare its performance with existing approaches. L3IS shows a 99.90% success rate in a challenging on-ramp merging case generated from the real US Highway 101 data. We further perform a sensitivity analysis on AL3IS to evaluate its robustness against varying observation delays, which demonstrates an acceptable performance of 93.84% success rate in 1-second V2V communication delay. et.al.|[2403.11852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11852)|null|

However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set. Importantly, our Graph BEV outperforms BEV Fusion by 8.3\% under conditions with misalignment noise. et.al.|[2403.11848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11848)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**EMIE-MAP: Large-Scale Road Surface Reconstruction Based on Explicit Mesh and Implicit Encoding**|Road surface reconstruction plays a vital role in autonomous driving systems, enabling road lane perception and high-precision mapping. Recently, neural implicit encoding has achieved remarkable results in scene representation, particularly in the realistic rendering of scene textures. However, it faces challenges in directly representing geometric information for large-scale scenes. To address this, we propose EMIE-MAP, a novel method for large-scale road surface reconstruction based on explicit mesh and implicit encoding. The road geometry is represented using explicit mesh, where each vertex stores implicit encoding representing the color and semantic information. To overcome the difficulty in optimizing road elevation, we introduce a trajectory-based elevation initialization and an elevation residual learning method based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Additionally, by employing implicit encoding and multi-camera color MLPs decoding, we achieve separate modeling of scene physical properties and camera characteristics, allowing surround-view reconstruction compatible with different camera models. Our method achieves remarkable road surface reconstruction performance in a variety of real-world challenging scenarios. et.al.|[2403.11789](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11789)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**TrajectoryNAS: A Neural Architecture Search for Trajectory Prediction**|Autonomous driving systems are a rapidly evolving technology that enables driverless car production. Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, enabling cars to anticipate the movements of surrounding objects for safe navigation. Trajectory prediction using Lidar point-cloud data performs better than 2D images due to providing 3D information. However, processing point-cloud data is more complicated and time-consuming than 2D images. Hence, state-of-the-art 3D trajectory predictions using point-cloud data suffer from slow and erroneous predictions. This paper introduces TrajectoryNAS, a pioneering method that focuses on utilizing point cloud data for trajectory prediction. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), TrajectoryNAS automates the design of trajectory prediction models, encompassing object detection, tracking, and forecasting in a cohesive manner. This approach not only addresses the complex interdependencies among these tasks but also emphasizes the importance of accuracy and efficiency in trajectory modeling. Through empirical studies, TrajectoryNAS demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant advancement in the field.Experimental results reveal that TrajcetoryNAS yield a minimum of 4.8 higger accuracy and 1.1* lower latency over competing methods on the NuScenes dataset. et.al.|[2403.11695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11695)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**SSAP: A Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch for Comprehensive Disruption of Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Navigation Applications**|Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has advanced significantly, primarily through the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more recently, Transformers. However, concerns about their susceptibility to adversarial attacks have emerged, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Existing approaches for assessing CNN-based depth prediction methods have fallen short in inducing comprehensive disruptions to the vision system, often limited to specific local areas. In this paper, we introduce SSAP (Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch), a novel approach designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation (MDE) in autonomous navigation applications. Our patch is crafted to selectively undermine MDE in two distinct ways: by distorting estimated distances or by creating the illusion of an object disappearing from the system's perspective. Notably, our patch is shape-sensitive, meaning it considers the specific shape and scale of the target object, thereby extending its influence beyond immediate proximity. Furthermore, our patch is trained to effectively address different scales and distances from the camera. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach induces a mean depth estimation error surpassing 0.5, impacting up to 99% of the targeted region for CNN-based MDE models. Additionally, we investigate the vulnerability of Transformer-based MDE models to patch-based attacks, revealing that SSAP yields a significant error of 0.59 and exerts substantial influence over 99% of the target region on these models. et.al.|[2403.11515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11515)|null|

However, existing well-annotated datasets are biased towards autonomous driving scenarios, while unlabelled SLAM datasets are quickly over-fitted, and often lack environment and domain variations. To expand the frontier of these fields, we introduce a comprehensive dataset named MCD (Multi-Campus Dataset), featuring a wide range of sensing modalities, high-accuracy ground truth, and diverse challenging environments across three Eurasian university campuses. MCD comprises both CCS (Classical Cylindrical Spinning) and NRE (Non-Repetitive Epicyclic) lidars, high-quality IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), cameras, and UWB (Ultra-WideBand) sensors. Furthermore, in a pioneering effort, we introduce semantic annotations of 29 classes over 59k sparse NRE lidar scans across three domains, thus providing a novel challenge to existing semantic segmentation research upon this largely unexplored lidar modality. Finally, we propose, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, continuous-time ground truth based on optimization-based registration of lidar-inertial data on large survey-grade prior maps, which are also publicly released, each several times the size of existing ones. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of numerous state-of-the-art algorithms on MCD, report their performance, and highlight the challenges awaiting solutions from the research community. et.al.|[2403.11496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11496)|null|
|**2024-03-17**|**Driving Style Alignment for LLM-powered Driver Agent**|Recently, LLM-powered driver agents have demonstrated considerable potential in the field of autonomous driving, showcasing human-like reasoning and decision-making abilities.However, current research on aligning driver agent behaviors with human driving styles remains limited, partly due to the scarcity of high-quality natural language data from human driving behaviors.To address this research gap, we propose a multi-alignment framework designed to align driver agents with human driving styles through demonstrations and feedback. Notably, we construct a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving interviews, offering high-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment. The framework's effectiveness is validated through simulation experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human evaluations. Our research offers valuable insights into designing driving agents with diverse driving styles.The implementation of the framework and details of the dataset can be found at the link. et.al.|[2403.11368](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11368)|null|
|**2024-03-17**|**Multi-Sample Long Range Path Planning under Sensing Uncertainty for Off-Road Autonomous Driving**|We focus on the problem of long-range dynamic replanning for off-road autonomous vehicles, where a robot plans paths through a previously unobserved environment while continuously receiving noisy local observations. An effective approach for planning under sensing uncertainty is determinization, where one converts a stochastic world into a deterministic one and plans under this simplification. This makes the planning problem tractable, but the cost of following the planned path in the real world may be different than in the determinized world. This causes collisions if the determinized world optimistically ignores obstacles, or causes unnecessarily long routes if the determinized world pessimistically imagines more obstacles. We aim to be robust to uncertainty over potential worlds while still achieving the efficiency benefits of determinization. We evaluate algorithms for dynamic replanning on a large real-world dataset of challenging long-range planning problems from the DARPA RACER program. Our method, Dynamic Replanning via Evaluating and Aggregating Multiple Samples (DREAMS), outperforms other determinization-based approaches in terms of combined traversal time and collision cost. https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/dreams/ et.al.|[2403.11298](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11298)|null|
|**2024-03-17**|**Large Language Models Powered Context-aware Motion Prediction**|Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts -- Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7\% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving. et.al.|[2403.11057](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11057)|null|
|**2024-03-16**|**Neuro-Symbolic Video Search**|The unprecedented surge in video data production in recent years necessitates efficient tools to extract meaningful frames from videos for downstream tasks. Long-term temporal reasoning is a key desideratum for frame retrieval systems. While state-of-the-art foundation models, like VideoLLaMA and ViCLIP, are proficient in short-term semantic understanding, they surprisingly fail at long-term reasoning across frames. A key reason for this failure is that they intertwine per-frame perception and temporal reasoning into a single deep network. Hence, decoupling but co-designing semantic understanding and temporal reasoning is essential for efficient scene identification. We propose a system that leverages vision-language models for semantic understanding of individual frames but effectively reasons about the long-term evolution of events using state machines and temporal logic (TL) formulae that inherently capture memory. Our TL-based reasoning improves the F1 score of complex event identification by 9-15% compared to benchmarks that use GPT4 for reasoning on state-of-the-art self-driving datasets such as Waymo and NuScenes. et.al.|[2403.11021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11021)|null|

Due to the lack of a rigorous definition of explainable AI (XAI), a plethora of research related to explainability, interpretability, and transparency has been developed to explain and analyze the model from various perspectives. Consequently, with an exhaustive list of papers, it becomes challenging to have a comprehensive overview of XAI research from all aspects. Considering the popularity of neural networks in AI research, we narrow our focus to a specific area of XAI research: gradient based explanations, which can be directly adopted for neural network models. In this review, we systematically explore gradient based explanation methods to date and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize them into four distinct classes. Then, we present the essence of technique details in chronological order and underscore the evolution of algorithms. Next, we introduce both human and quantitative evaluations to measure algorithm performance. More importantly, we demonstrate the general challenges in XAI and specific challenges in gradient based explanations. We hope that this survey can help researchers understand state-of-the-art progress and their corresponding disadvantages, which could spark their interest in addressing these issues in future work. et.al.|[2403.10415](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10415)|null|
|**2024-03-15**|**Real-Time Image Segmentation via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search**|Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attentions due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require lots of trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high resolution representation CNNs efficiently, by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features, but also finds the proper location for placing multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objective s (e.g., latency and mIoU) and capable of finding architectures on Pareto frontier with arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of model via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searched for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuse to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods on semantic segmentation task.

|**2024-03-15**|**SimPB: A Single Model for 2D and 3D Object Detection from Multiple Cameras**|The field of autonomous driving has attracted considerable interest in approaches that directly infer 3D objects in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) from multiple cameras. Some attempts have also explored utilizing 2D detectors from single images to enhance the performance of 3D detection. However, these approaches rely on a two-stage process with separate detectors, where the 2D detection results are utilized only once for token selection or query initialization. In this paper, we present a single model termed SimPB, which simultaneously detects 2D objects in the perspective view and 3D objects in the BEV space from multiple cameras. To achieve this, we introduce a hybrid decoder consisting of several multi-view 2D decoder layers and several 3D decoder layers, specifically designed for their respective detection tasks. A Dynamic Query Allocation module and an Adaptive Query Aggregation module are proposed to continuously update and refine the interaction between 2D and 3D results, in a cyclic 3D-2D-3D manner. Additionally, Query-group Attention is utilized to strengthen the interaction among 2D queries within each camera group. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate promising results for both 2D and 3D detection tasks.

|**2024-03-15**|**CoLeCLIP: Open-Domain Continual Learning via Joint Task Prompt and Vocabulary Learning**|This paper explores the problem of continual learning (CL) of vision-language models (VLMs) in open domains, where the models need to perform continual updating and inference on a streaming of datasets from diverse seen and unseen domains with novel classes. Such a capability is crucial for various applications in open environments, e.g., AI assistants, autonomous driving systems, and robotics. Current CL studies mostly focus on closed-set scenarios in a single domain with known classes. Large pre-trained VLMs like CLIP have demonstrated superior zero-shot recognition ability, and a number of recent studies leverage this ability to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CL, but they focus on closed-set CL in a single domain dataset. Open-domain CL of large VLMs is significantly more challenging due to 1) large class correlations and domain gaps across the datasets and 2) the forgetting of zero-shot knowledge in the pre-trained VLMs in addition to the knowledge learned from the newly adapted datasets. In this work we introduce a novel approach, termed CoLeCLIP, that learns an open-domain CL model based on CLIP. It addresses these challenges by a joint learning of a set of task prompts and a cross-domain class vocabulary. Extensive experiments on 11 domain datasets show that CoLeCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for open-domain CL under both task- and class-incremental learning settings. et.al.|[2403.10245](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10245)|null|

However, existing roadside perception approaches only focus on the single-infrastructure sensor system, which cannot realize a comprehensive understanding of a traffic area because of the limited sensing range and blind spots. Orienting high-quality roadside perception, we need Roadside Cooperative Perception (RCooper) to achieve practical area-coverage roadside perception for restricted traffic areas. Rcooper has its own domain-specific challenges, but further exploration is hindered due to the lack of datasets. We hence release the first real-world, large-scale RCooper dataset to bloom the research on practical roadside cooperative perception, including detection and tracking. The manually annotated dataset comprises 50k images and 30k point clouds, including two representative traffic scenes (i.e., intersection and corridor).

Although previous V-HOI detection models have made significant strides in accurate detection on specific datasets, they still lack the general reasoning ability like human beings to effectively induce HOI relationships. In this study, we propose V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR), a novel framework consisting of a series of plug-and-play modules that could facilitate the performance of current V-HOI detection models by leveraging the strong reasoning ability of different off-the-shelf pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We design a two-stage collaboration system of different LLMs for the V-HOI task. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme to leverage the LLM conduct reasoning from different aspects.

While recent efforts have explored deep generative models to address this issue, they often consume substantial computational resources with slow generation speeds while suffering from a lack of realism. To address these limitations, we introduce RangeLDM, a novel approach for rapidly generating high-quality range-view LiDAR point clouds via latent diffusion models. We achieve this by correcting range-view data distribution for accurate projection from point clouds to range images via Hough voting, which has a critical impact on generative learning. We then compress the range images into a latent space with a variational autoencoder, and leverage a diffusion model to enhance expressivity. Additionally, we instruct the model to preserve 3D structural fidelity by devising a range-guided discriminator. Experimental results on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate both the robust expressiveness and fast speed of our LiDAR point cloud generation. et.al.|[2403.10094](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10094)|null|

Various methods of utilizing images to enhance the performance of cross-domain 3D segmentation have recently emerged. However, the pseudo labels, which are generated from models trained on the source domain and provide additional supervised signals for the unseen domain, are inadequate when utilized for 3D segmentation due to their inherent noisiness and consequently restrict the accuracy of neural networks. With the advent of 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) and their abundant knowledge prior, we propose a novel pipeline VFMSeg to further enhance the cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework by leveraging these models. In this work, we study how to harness the knowledge priors learned by VFMs to produce more accurate labels for unlabeled target domains and improve overall performance. We first utilize a multi-modal VFM, which is pre-trained on large scale image-text pairs, to provide supervised labels (VFM-PL) for images and point clouds from the target domain. Then, another VFM trained on fine-grained 2D masks is adopted to guide the generation of semantically augmented images and point clouds to enhance the performance of neural networks, which mix the data from source and target domains like view frustums (FrustumMixing). Finally, we merge class-wise prediction across modalities to produce more accurate annotations for unlabeled target domains.

Given that such models are trained on a humongous amount of online knowledge, we hypothesize that LLMs can assess whether driving scenarios generated by autonomous driving testing techniques are realistic, i.e., being aligned with real-world driving conditions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an empirical evaluation to assess whether LLMs are effective and robust in performing the task. This reality check is an important step towards devising LLM-based autonomous driving testing techniques. For our empirical evaluation, we selected 64 realistic scenarios from \deepscenario--an open driving scenario dataset. Next, by introducing minor changes to them, we created 512 additional realistic scenarios, to form an overall dataset of 576 scenarios. With this dataset, we evaluated three LLMs (\gpt, \llama, and \mistral) to assess their robustness in assessing the realism of driving scenarios. Our results show that: (1) Overall, \gpt achieved the highest robustness compared to \llama and \mistral, consistently throughout almost all scenarios, roads, and weather conditions; (2) \mistral performed the worst consistently; (3) \llama achieved good results under certain conditions; and (4) roads and weather conditions do influence the robustness of the LLMs. et.al.|[2403.09906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09906)|null|

Detecting Autonomous Vehicles from Behavior Analysis**|The tremendous hype around autonomous driving is eagerly calling for emerging and novel technologies to support advanced mobility use cases. As car manufactures keep developing SAE level 3+ systems to improve the safety and comfort of passengers, traffic authorities need to establish new procedures to manage the transition from human-driven to fully-autonomous vehicles while providing a feedback-loop mechanism to fine-tune envisioned autonomous systems. Thus, a way to automatically profile autonomous vehicles and differentiate those from human-driven ones is a must. In this paper, we present a fully-fledged framework that monitors active vehicles using camera images and state information in order to determine whether vehicles are autonomous, without requiring any active notification from the vehicles themselves. Essentially, it builds on the cooperation among vehicles, which share their data acquired on the road feeding a machine learning model to identify autonomous cars.

This is especially true for complex AI-enabled and software intensive systems such as Autonomous Drive (AD). System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a novel method applied in safety-related fields like defense and aerospace, which is also becoming popular in the automotive industry. However, STPA assumes prerequisites that are not fully valid in the automotive system engineering with distributed system development and multi-abstraction design levels. This would inhibit software developers from using STPA to analyze their software as part of a bigger system, resulting in a lack of traceability. This can be seen as a maintainability challenge in continuous development and deployment (DevOps). In this paper, STPA's different guidelines for the automotive industry, e.g. J31887/ISO21448/STPA handbook, are firstly compared to assess their applicability to the distributed development of complex AI-enabled systems like AD. Further, an approach to overcome the challenges of using STPA in a multi-level design context is proposed.

Having demonstrated its potential in such domains, it may have the potential to also improve the software development for automotive functions as some OEMs described on a high level in their financial company communiqus. However, the application of a CDDM strategy also faces challenges from a process adherence and documentation perspective as required by safety-related products such as autonomous driving systems (ADS) and guided by industry standards such as ISO-26262 and ISO21448. There are publications on CDDM in safety-relevant contexts that focus on safety-critical functions on a rather generic level and thus, not specifically ADS or automotive, or that are concentrating only on software and hence, missing out the particular context of an automotive OEM: Well-established legacy processes and the need of their adaptations, and aspects originating from the role of being a system integrator for software/software, hardware/hardware, and hardware/software. In this paper, particular challenges from the automotive domain to better adopt CDDM are identified and discussed to shed light on research gaps to enhance CDDM, especially for the software development of safe ADS. The challenges are identified from today's industrial well-established ways of working by conducting interviews with domain experts and complemented by a literature study. et.al.|[2403.09474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09474)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**EfficientMFD: Towards More Efficient Multimodal Synchronous Fusion Detection**|Multimodal image fusion and object detection play a vital role in autonomous driving. Current joint learning methods have made significant progress in the multimodal fusion detection task combining the texture detail and objective semantic information. However, the tedious training steps have limited its applications to wider real-world industrial deployment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end multimodal fusion detection algorithm, named EfficientMFD, to simplify models that exhibit decent performance with only one training step. Synchronous joint optimization is utilized in an end-to-end manner between two components, thus not being affected by the local optimal solution of the individual task. Besides, a comprehensive optimization is established in the gradient matrix between the shared parameters for both tasks. It can converge to an optimal point with fusion detection weights. We extensively test it on several public datasets, demonstrating superior performance on not only visually appealing fusion but also favorable detection performance (e.g., 6.6% mAP50:95) over other state-of-the-art approaches. et.al.|[2403.09323](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09323)|**[link](https://github.com/icey-zhang/efficientmfd)**|
|**2024-03-14**|**Intention-aware Denoising Diffusion Model for Trajectory Prediction**|Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving, particularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent uncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to produce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of them suffer from restricted representation ability or unstable training issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to generate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled to realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with the uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize. Second, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase, rendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose an Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which tackles the above two problems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and action uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To decrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the intention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the action-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with an FDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on the ETH/UCY dataset. Compared with the original diffusion model, IDM reduces inference time by two-thirds. Interestingly, our experiments further reveal that introducing intention information is beneficial in modeling the diffusion process of fewer steps. et.al.|[2403.09190](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09190)|null|

Despite significant advancements in these systems recently, challenges persist under conditions like occlusion, extreme lighting, or in unfamiliar urban areas. Unlike these systems, humans do not solely depend on immediate observations to perceive the environment. In navigating new cities, humans gradually develop a preliminary mental map to supplement real-time perception during subsequent visits. Inspired by this human approach, we introduce a novel framework, Pre-Sight, that leverages past traversals to construct static prior memories, enhancing online perception in later navigations. Our method involves optimizing a city-scale neural radiance field with data from previous journeys to generate neural priors.

Autonomous driving systems heavily rely on accurate object detection algorithms, but adverse weather conditions can significantly impact the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs).   Existing approaches fall into two main categories, 1) image enhancement such as IA-YOLO 2) domain adaptation based approaches. Image enhancement based techniques attempt to generate fog-free image. However, retrieving a fogless image from a foggy image is a much harder problem than detecting objects in a foggy image. Domain-adaptation based approaches, on the other hand, do not make use of labelled datasets in the target domain. Both categories of approaches are attempting to solve a harder version of the problem. Our approach builds over fine-tuning on the   Our framework is specifically designed to compensate for foggy conditions present in the scene, ensuring robust performance even. We adopt YOLOv3 as the baseline object detection algorithm and introduce a novel Teacher-Student Perceptual loss, to high accuracy object detection in foggy images.   Through extensive evaluations on common datasets such as PASCAL VOC and RTTS, we demonstrate the improvement in performance achieved by our network. We demonstrate that FogGuard achieves 69.43\% mAP, as compared to 57.78\% for YOLOv3 on the RTTS dataset.   Furthermore, we show that while our training method increases time complexity, it does not introduce any additional overhead during inference compared to the regular YOLO network. et.al.|[2403.08939](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08939)|null|

Existing pre-training methods either rely on expensive supervised learning with 3D annotations, limiting the scalability, or focus on single-frame or monocular inputs, neglecting the temporal information. We propose MIM4D, a novel pre-training paradigm based on dual masked image modeling (MIM). MIM4D leverages both spatial and temporal relations by training on masked multi-view video inputs. It constructs pseudo-3D features using continuous scene flow and projects them onto 2D plane for supervision. To address the lack of dense 3D supervision, MIM4D reconstruct pixels by employing 3D volumetric differentiable rendering to learn geometric representations. We demonstrate that MIM4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset for visual representation learning in autonomous driving. It significantly improves existing methods on multiple downstream tasks, including BEV segmentation (8.7% IoU), 3D object detection (3.5% mAP), and HD map construction (1.4% mAP).

A compact way to represent scenes while encoding geometric distances and semantic object information is via 3D semantic occupancy maps. State of the art 3D mapping methods leverage transformers with cross-attention mechanisms to elevate 2D vision-centric camera features into the 3D domain. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-time applications due to their high computational demands during inference. This limitation is particularly problematic in autonomous vehicles, where GPU resources must be shared with other tasks such as localization and planning. In this paper, we introduce an approach that extracts features from front-view 2D camera images and LiDAR scans, then employs a sparse convolution network (Minkowski Engine), for 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Given that outdoor scenes in autonomous driving scenarios are inherently sparse, the utilization of sparse convolution is particularly apt. By jointly solving the problems of 3D scene completion of sparse scenes and 3D semantic segmentation, we provide a more efficient learning framework suitable for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. We also demonstrate competitive accuracy on the nuScenes dataset. et.al.|[2403.08748](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08748)|null|

Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a duplex-encoder teacher model into a single-encoder student model is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue.

We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two technical novelties: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. et.al.|[2403.08215](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08215)|null|

However, almost all current multi-view systems rely on given ideal camera poses, which are unavailable in many real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a new robustness benchmark to evaluate the depth estimation system under various noisy pose settings. Surprisingly, we find current multi-view depth estimation methods or single-view and multi-view fusion methods will fail when given noisy pose settings. To address this challenge, we propose a single-view and multi-view fused depth estimation system, which adaptively integrates high-confident multi-view and single-view results for both robust and accurate depth estimations. The adaptive fusion module performs fusion by dynamically selecting high-confidence regions between two branches based on a wrapping confidence map. Thus, the system tends to choose the more reliable branch when facing textureless scenes, inaccurate calibration, dynamic objects, and other degradation or challenging conditions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view and fusion methods under robustness testing.

We consider quantifying such uncertainty for multi-object detection. In particular, we leverage conformal prediction to obtain uncertainty intervals with guaranteed coverage for object bounding boxes. One challenge in doing so is that bounding box predictions are conditioned on the object's class label. Thus, we develop a novel two-step conformal approach that propagates uncertainty in predicted class labels into the uncertainty intervals for the bounding boxes. This broadens the validity of our conformal coverage guarantees to include incorrectly classified objects, ensuring their usefulness when maximal safety assurances are required. Moreover, we investigate novel ensemble and quantile regression formulations to ensure the bounding box intervals are adaptive to object size, leading to a more balanced coverage across sizes. Validating our two-step approach on real-world datasets for 2D bounding box localization, we find that desired coverage levels are satisfied with actionably tight predictive uncertainty intervals. et.al.|[2403.07263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07263)|null|

Mapless online path planning is particularly of practical appeal but poses a challenge for safely overtaking opponents due to the limited planning horizon. Accordingly, this paper introduces RaceMOP, a novel method for mapless online path planning designed for multi-agent racing of F1TENTH cars. Unlike classical planners that depend on predefined racing lines, RaceMOP operates without a map, relying solely on local observations to overtake other race cars at high speed. Our approach combines an artificial potential field method as a base policy with residual policy learning to introduce long-horizon planning capabilities.

Despite the recent success of point cloud neural networks, especially for safety-critical tasks, it is essential to also ensure the robustness of the model. A typical way to assess a model's robustness is through adversarial attacks, where test-time examples are generated based on gradients to deceive the model. While many different defense mechanisms are studied in 2D, studies on 3D point clouds have been relatively limited in the academic field. Inspired from PointDP, which denoises the network inputs by diffusion, we propose Point Cloud Layerwise Diffusion (PCLD), a layerwise diffusion based 3D point cloud defense strategy.

It provides the vehicle with the ability to comprehend its surroundings and make informed decisions. Depth prediction plays a pivotal role in this process, as it helps the understanding of the geometry and motion of the environment. This thesis focuses on the challenge of depth prediction using monocular self-supervised learning techniques. The problem is approached from a broader perspective first, exploring conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as a potential technique to achieve better generalization was performed. In doing so, a fundamental contribution to the conditional GANs, the acontrario cGAN was proposed. The second contribution entails a single image-to-depth self-supervised method, proposing a solution for the rigid-scene assumption using a novel transformer-based method that outputs a pose for each dynamic object. The third significant aspect involves the introduction of a video-to-depth map forecasting approach. This method serves as an extension of self-supervised techniques to predict future depths. This involves the creation of a novel transformer model capable of predicting the future depth of a given scene. Moreover, the various limitations of the aforementioned methods were addressed and a video-to-video depth maps model was proposed. This model leverages the spatio-temporal consistency of the input and output sequence to predict a more accurate depth sequence output.

Traditional point-based 3D object detectors often employ architectures that rely on a progressive downsampling of points. While this method effectively reduces computational demands and increases receptive fields, it will compromise the preservation of crucial non-local information for accurate 3D object detection, especially in the complex driving scenarios. To address this, we introduce an intriguing Cross-Cluster Shifting operation to unleash the representation capacity of the point-based detector by efficiently modeling longer-range inter-dependency while including only a negligible overhead. Concretely, the Cross-Cluster Shifting operation enhances the conventional design by shifting partial channels from neighboring clusters, which enables richer interaction with non-local regions and thus enlarges the receptive field of clusters. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Shift-SSD in both detection accuracy and runtime efficiency. et.al.|[2403.06166](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06166)|null|

|**2024-03-09**|**Fast Kernel Scene Flow**|In contrast to current state-of-the-art methods, such as NSFP [25], which employ deep implicit neural functions for modeling scene flow, we present a novel approach that utilizes classical kernel representations. This representation enables our approach to effectively handle dense lidar points while demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency -- compared to recent deep approaches -- achieved through the solution of a linear system. As a runtime optimization-based method, our model exhibits impressive generalizability across various out-of-distribution scenarios, achieving competitive performance on large-scale lidar datasets. We propose a new positional encoding-based kernel that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in efficient lidar scene flow estimation on large-scale point clouds. An important highlight of our method is its near real-time performance (~150-170 ms) with dense lidar data (~8k-144k points), enabling a variety of practical applications in robotics and autonomous driving scenarios. et.al.|[2403.05896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05896)|null|
|**2024-03-09**|**SAFDNet: A Simple and Effective Network for Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection**|LiDAR-based 3D object detection plays an essential role in autonomous driving. Existing high-performing 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the backbone network and prediction head. However, the computational costs introduced by the dense feature maps grow quadratically as the perception range increases, making these models hard to scale up to long-range detection. Some recent works have attempted to construct fully sparse detectors to solve this issue; nevertheless, the resulting models either rely on a complex multi-stage pipeline or exhibit inferior performance. In this work, we propose SAFDNet, a straightforward yet highly effective architecture, tailored for fully sparse 3D object detection. In SAFDNet, an adaptive feature diffusion strategy is designed to address the center feature missing problem. We conducted extensive experiments on Waymo Open, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 datasets. SAFDNet performed slightly better than the previous SOTA on the first two datasets but much better on the last dataset, which features long-range detection, verifying the efficacy of SAFDNet in scenarios where long-range detection is required. Notably, on Argoverse2, SAFDNet surpassed the previous best hybrid detector HEDNet by 2.6% mAP while being 2.1x faster, and yielded 2.1% mAP gains over the previous best sparse detector FSDv2 while being 1.3x faster.

Our evaluations show that these objectives are complementary and outperform recent contrastive and autoencoding methods as pre-training for joint motion prediction. Furthermore, JointMotion adapts to all common types of environment representations used for motion prediction (i.e., agent-centric, scene-centric, and pairwise relative), and enables effective transfer learning between the Waymo Open Motion and the Argoverse 2 Forecasting datasets. Notably, our method improves the joint final displacement error of Wayformer, Scene Transformer, and HPTR by 3%, 7%, and 11%, respectively. et.al.|[2403.05489](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05489)|null|
|**2024-03-08**|**OccFusion: Depth Estimation Free Multi-sensor Fusion for 3D Occupancy Prediction**|3D occupancy prediction based on multi-sensor fusion, crucial for a reliable autonomous driving system, enables fine-grained understanding of 3D scenes. Previous fusion-based 3D occupancy predictions relied on depth estimation for processing 2D image features. However, depth estimation is an ill-posed problem, hindering the accuracy and robustness of these methods. Furthermore, fine-grained occupancy prediction demands extensive computational resources. We introduce OccFusion, a multi-modal fusion method free from depth estimation, and a corresponding point cloud sampling algorithm for dense integration of image features. Building on this, we propose an active training method and an active coarse to fine pipeline, enabling the model to adaptively learn more from complex samples and optimize predictions specifically for challenging areas such as small or overlapping objects. The active methods we propose can be naturally extended to any occupancy prediction model. Experiments on the OpenOccupancy benchmark show our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-modal methods in IoU across all categories. Additionally, our model is more efficient during both the training and inference phases, requiring far fewer computational resources. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques. et.al.|[2403.05329](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05329)|null|
|**2024-03-08**|**DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation**|Scene flow estimation is an essential ingredient for a variety of real-world applications, especially for autonomous agents, such as self-driving cars and robots. While recent scene flow estimation approaches achieve a reasonable accuracy, their applicability to real-world systems additionally benefits from a reliability measure. Aiming at improving accuracy while additionally providing an estimate for uncertainty, we propose DiffSF that combines transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions. et.al.|[2403.05327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05327)|null|
|**2024-03-08**|**LVIC: Multi-modality segmentation by Lifting Visual Info as Cue**|Multi-modality fusion is proven an effective method for 3d perception for autonomous driving. However, most current multi-modality fusion pipelines for LiDAR semantic segmentation have complicated fusion mechanisms. Point painting is a quite straight forward method which directly bind LiDAR points with visual information. Unfortunately, previous point painting like methods suffer from projection error between camera and LiDAR. In our experiments, we find that this projection error is the devil in point painting. As a result of that, we propose a depth aware point painting mechanism, which significantly boosts the multi-modality fusion. Apart from that, we take a deeper look at the desired visual feature for LiDAR to operate semantic segmentation. By Lifting Visual Information as Cue, LVIC ranks 1st on nuScenes LiDAR semantic segmentation benchmark. Our experiments show the robustness and effectiveness.

|**2024-03-08**|**LanePtrNet: Revisiting Lane Detection as Point Voting and Grouping on Curves**|Lane detection plays a critical role in the field of autonomous driving. Prevailing methods generally adopt basic concepts (anchors, key points, etc.) from object detection and segmentation tasks, while these approaches require manual adjustments for curved objects, involve exhaustive searches on predefined anchors, require complex post-processing steps, and may lack flexibility when applied to real-world scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, LanePtrNet, which treats lane detection as a process of point voting and grouping on ordered sets: Our method takes backbone features as input and predicts a curve-aware centerness, which represents each lane as a point and assigns the most probable center point to it. A novel point sampling method is proposed to generate a set of candidate points based on the votes received. By leveraging features from local neighborhoods, and cross-instance attention score, we design a grouping module that further performs lane-wise clustering between neighboring and seeding points. Furthermore, our method can accommodate a point-based framework, (PointNet++ series, etc.) as an alternative to the backbone. This flexibility enables effortless extension to 3D lane detection tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, demonstrating its superior performance. et.al.|[2403.05155](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05155)|null|

By integrating specialized pre-trained branch networks, fine-tuned for various environmental conditions, DyRoNet achieves a balance between latency and precision. Its core feature, the speed router module, intelligently directs input data to the best-suited branch network, optimizing performance. The extensive evaluations reveal that DyRoNet adapts effectively to multiple branch selection strategies, setting a new benchmark in performance across a range of scenarios.

However, there are still many challenges (e.g. difficulties of map storage, poor localization robustness in large scenes) in accurately and efficiently implementing cross-modal localization. To solve these problems, a novel pipeline termed LHMap-loc is proposed, which achieves accurate and efficient monocular localization in LiDAR maps. Firstly, feature encoding is carried out on the original LiDAR point cloud map by generating offline heat point clouds, by which the size of the original LiDAR map is compressed. Then, an end-to-end online pose regression network is designed based on optical flow estimation and spatial attention to achieve real-time monocular visual localization in a pre-built map. In addition, a series of experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

|**2024-03-07**|**Fooling Neural Networks for Motion Forecasting via Adversarial Attacks**|Human motion prediction is still an open problem, which is extremely important for autonomous driving and safety applications. Although there are great advances in this area, the widely studied topic of adversarial attacks has not been applied to multi-regression models such as GCNs and MLP-based architectures in human motion prediction. This work intends to reduce this gap using extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments in state-of-the-art architectures similar to the initial stages of adversarial attacks in image classification. The results suggest that models are susceptible to attacks even on low levels of perturbation. We also show experiments with 3D transformations that affect the model performance, in particular, we show that most models are sensitive to simple rotations and translations which do not alter joint distances. We conclude that similar to earlier CNN models, motion forecasting tasks are susceptible to small perturbations and simple 3D transformations. et.al.|[2403.04954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04954)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**A General Calibrated Regret Metric for Detecting and Mitigating Human-Robot Interaction Failures**|Robot decision-making increasingly relies on expressive data-driven human prediction models when operating around people. While these models are known to suffer from prediction errors in out-of-distribution interactions, not all prediction errors equally impact downstream robot performance. We identify that the mathematical notion of regret precisely characterizes the degree to which incorrect predictions of future interaction outcomes degraded closed-loop robot performance. However, canonical regret measures are poorly calibrated across diverse deployment interactions. We extend the canonical notion of regret by deriving a calibrated regret metric that generalizes from absolute reward space to probability space. With this transformation, our metric removes the need for explicit reward functions to calculate the robot's regret, enables fairer comparison of interaction anomalies across disparate deployment contexts, and facilitates targetted dataset construction of "system-level" prediction failures. We experimentally quantify the value of this high-regret interaction data for aiding the robot in improving its downstream decision-making. In a suite of closed-loop autonomous driving simulations, we find that fine-tuning ego-conditioned behavior predictors exclusively on high-regret human-robot interaction data can improve the robot's overall re-deployment performance with significantly (77%) less data. et.al.|[2403.04745](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04745)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Embodied Understanding of Driving Scenarios**|Embodied scene understanding serves as the cornerstone for autonomous agents to perceive, interpret, and respond to open driving scenarios. Such understanding is typically founded upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Nevertheless, existing VLMs are restricted to the 2D domain, devoid of spatial awareness and long-horizon extrapolation proficiencies. We revisit the key aspects of autonomous driving and formulate appropriate rubrics. Hereby, we introduce the Embodied Language Model (ELM), a comprehensive framework tailored for agents' understanding of driving scenes with large spatial and temporal spans. ELM incorporates space-aware pre-training to endow the agent with robust spatial localization capabilities. Besides, the model employs time-aware token selection to accurately inquire about temporal cues. We instantiate ELM on the reformulated multi-faced benchmark, and it surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects.

|**2024-03-07**|**FriendNet: Detection-Friendly Dehazing Network**|Adverse weather conditions often impair the quality of captured images, inevitably inducing cutting-edge object detection models for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

|**2024-03-07**|**LitSim: Conflict-aware Policy for Long-term Interactive Traffic Simulation**|Simulation is pivotal in evaluating the performance of autonomous driving systems due to the advantages in efficiency and cost compared to on-road testing. Realistic multi-agent behavior~(e.g., interactive and long-term) is needed to narrow the gap between the simulation and the reality. The existing work has the following shortcomings in achieving this goal:~(1) log replay offers realistic scenarios but leads to unrealistic collisions due to lacking dynamic interactions, and~(2) model-based and learning-based solutions encourage interactions but often deviate from real-world data in long horizons. In this work, we propose LitSim, a long-term interactive simulation approach that maximizes realism while avoiding unrealistic collisions. Specifically, we replay the log for most scenarios and intervene only when LitSim predicts unrealistic conflicts. We then encourage interactions among the agents and resolve the conflicts, thereby reducing the likelihood of unrealistic collisions. We train and validate our model on the real-world dataset NGSIM, and the experimental results demonstrate that LitSim outperforms the current popular approaches in realism and reactivity. et.al.|[2403.04299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04299)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Generalizing Cooperative Eco-driving via Multi-residual Task Learning**|Conventional control, such as model-based control, is commonly utilized in autonomous driving due to its efficiency and reliability. However, real-world autonomous driving contends with a multitude of diverse traffic scenarios that are challenging for these planning algorithms. Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents a promising avenue in this direction, but learning DRL control policies that generalize to multiple traffic scenarios is still a challenge. To address this, we introduce Multi-residual Task Learning (MRTL), a generic learning framework based on multi-task learning that, for a set of task scenarios, decomposes the control into nominal components that are effectively solved by conventional control methods and residual terms which are solved using learning. We employ MRTL for fleet-level emission reduction in mixed traffic using autonomous vehicles as a means of system control. By analyzing the performance of MRTL across nearly 600 signalized intersections and 1200 traffic scenarios, we demonstrate that it emerges as a promising approach to synergize the strengths of DRL and conventional methods in generalizable control. et.al.|[2403.04232](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04232)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Incremental Bayesian Learning for Fail-Operational Control in Autonomous Driving**|Abrupt maneuvers by surrounding vehicles (SVs) can typically lead to safety concerns and affect the task efficiency of the ego vehicle (EV), especially with model uncertainties stemming from environmental disturbances. This paper presents a real-time fail-operational controller that ensures the asymptotic convergence of an uncertain EV to a safe state, while preserving task efficiency in dynamic environments. An incremental Bayesian learning approach is developed to facilitate online learning and inference of changing environmental disturbances. Leveraging disturbance quantification and constraint transformation, we develop a stochastic fail-operational barrier based on the control barrier function (CBF). With this development, the uncertain EV is able to converge asymptotically from an unsafe state to a defined safe state with probabilistic stability. Subsequently, the stochastic fail-operational barrier is integrated into an efficient fail-operational controller based on quadratic programming (QP). This controller is tailored for the EV operating under control constraints in the presence of environmental disturbances, with both safety and efficiency objectives taken into consideration. We validate the proposed framework in connected cruise control (CCC) tasks, where SVs perform aggressive driving maneuvers. The simulation results demonstrate that our method empowers the EV to swiftly return to a safe state while upholding task efficiency in real time, even under time-varying environmental disturbances. et.al.|[2403.04143](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04143)|null|

Camera frames are processed with a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, whereas classical clustering techniques are used to process LiDAR observations. The proposed MOT algorithm comprises a three-step association process, an Extended Kalman filter for estimating the motion of each detected dynamic obstacle, and a track management phase. The EKF motion model requires the current measured relative position and orientation of the observed object and the longitudinal and angular velocities of the ego vehicle as inputs. Unlike most state-of-the-art multi-modal MOT approaches, the proposed algorithm does not rely on maps or knowledge of the ego global pose. Moreover, it uses a 3D detector exclusively for cameras and is agnostic to the type of LiDAR sensor used.

|**2024-03-06**|**Learning Adversarial MDPs with Stochastic Hard Constraints**|We study online learning problems in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with adversarial losses and stochastic hard constraints. We consider two different scenarios. In the first one, we address general CMDPs, where we design an algorithm that attains sublinear regret and cumulative positive constraints violation. In the second scenario, under the mild assumption that a policy strictly satisfying the constraints exists and is known to the learner, we design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every episode with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study CMDPs involving both adversarial losses and hard constraints. Indeed, previous works either focus on much weaker soft constraints--allowing for positive violation to cancel out negative ones--or are restricted to stochastic losses. Thus, our algorithms can deal with general non-stationary environments subject to requirements much stricter than those manageable with state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables their adoption in a much wider range of real-world applications, ranging from autonomous driving to online advertising and recommender systems. et.al.|[2403.03672](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03672)|null|

However, data fidelity in this paradigm is often degraded by VR inconsistency, for which the existing VR approaches become ineffective, as they ignore the inter-dependency between low-level VR synchronizer designs (i.e., data collector) and high-level VR synthesizer designs (i.e., data processor). This paper presents a seamless virtual reality SVR platform for AD, which mitigates such inconsistency, enabling VR agents to interact with each other in a shared symbiotic world. The crux to SVR is an integrated synchronizer and synthesizer IS2 design, which consists of a drift-aware lidar-inertial synchronizer for VR colocation and a motion-aware deep visual synthesis network for augmented reality image generation. We implement SVR on car-like robots in two sandbox platforms, achieving a cm-level VR colocalization accuracy and 3.2% VR image deviation, thereby avoiding missed collisions or model clippings. Experiments show that the proposed SVR reduces the intervention times, missed turns, and failure rates compared to other benchmarks. The SVR-trained neural network can handle unseen situations in real-world environments, by leveraging its knowledge learnt from the VR space. et.al.|[2403.03541](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03541)|null|

|**2024-03-05**|**Behavior Generation with Latent Actions**|Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a longstanding problem in decision making. Unlike language or image generation, decision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module. Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT's improved ability to capture behavior modes while accelerating inference speed 5x over Diffusion Policies.

Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms. et.al.|[2403.03111](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03111)|null|

The previously introduced framework, which interprets dynamic preferences as inherent uncertainty and includes a ``human-on-the-loop'' mechanism enabling users to give feedback when dissatisfied with system behaviors, addresses this gap. In this study, we further enhance the approach with a user study of 20 participants, focusing on aligning system behavior with user expectations through feedback-driven adaptation.

|**2024-03-05**|**ActiveAD: Planning-Oriented Active Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving**|End-to-end differentiable learning for autonomous driving (AD) has recently become a prominent paradigm. One main bottleneck lies in its voracious appetite for high-quality labeled data e.g. 3D bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, which are notoriously expensive to manually annotate. The difficulty is further pronounced due to the prominent fact that the behaviors within samples in AD often suffer from long tailed distribution. In other words, a large part of collected data can be trivial (e.g. simply driving forward in a straight road) and only a few cases are safety-critical. In this paper, we explore a practically important yet under-explored problem about how to achieve sample and label efficiency for end-to-end AD. Specifically, we design a planning-oriented active learning method which progressively annotates part of collected raw data according to the proposed diversity and usefulness criteria for planning routes. Empirically, we show that our planning-oriented approach could outperform general active learning methods by a large margin. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art end-to-end AD methods - by using only 30% nuScenes data. We hope our work could inspire future works to explore end-to-end AD from a data-centric perspective in addition to methodology efforts. et.al.|[2403.02877](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02877)|null|

We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions. We employ a hybrid simulation setup by coupling micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, and circuit simulation with Python programming to incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our proposed designs. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies that are comparable to software implementation. During training, our design consumes 43.59pJ of energy for synaptic weight updates. et.al.|[2403.02863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02863)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**FastOcc: Accelerating 3D Occupancy Prediction by Fusing the 2D Bird's-Eye View and Perspective View**|In autonomous driving, 3D occupancy prediction outputs voxel-wise status and semantic labels for more comprehensive understandings of 3D scenes compared with traditional perception tasks, such as 3D object detection and bird's-eye view (BEV) semantic segmentation. Recent researchers have extensively explored various aspects of this task, including view transformation techniques, ground-truth label generation, and elaborate network design, aiming to achieve superior performance. However, the inference speed, crucial for running on an autonomous vehicle, is neglected. To this end, a new method, dubbed FastOcc, is proposed. By carefully analyzing the network effect and latency from four parts, including the input image resolution, image backbone, view transformation, and occupancy prediction head, it is found that the occupancy prediction head holds considerable potential for accelerating the model while keeping its accuracy. Targeted at improving this component, the time-consuming 3D convolution network is replaced with a novel residual-like architecture, where features are mainly digested by a lightweight 2D BEV convolution network and compensated by integrating the 3D voxel features interpolated from the original image features. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that our FastOcc achieves state-of-the-art results with a fast inference speed. et.al.|[2403.02710](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02710)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**HoloVIC: Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Sensor Holographic Intersection and Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative**|Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is a popular topic in the field of Autonomous Driving in recent years. Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one of the important research area. Due to the complexity of traffic conditions such as blind spots and occlusion, it greatly limits the perception capabilities of single-view roadside sensing systems. To further enhance the accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle side, in this paper, we constructed holographic intersections with various layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure cooperation dataset, called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of sensors (Camera, Lidar, Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+ synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally, we annotated 3D bounding boxes based on Camera, Fisheye, and Lidar. We also associate the IDs of the same objects across different devices and consecutive frames in sequence. Based on HoloVIC, we formulated four tasks to facilitate the development of related research. We also provide benchmarks for these tasks. et.al.|[2403.02640](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02640)|null|

|**2024-03-04**|**Uncertainty-Aware Prediction and Application in Planning for Autonomous Driving: Definitions, Methods, and Comparison**|Autonomous driving systems face the formidable challenge of navigating intricate and dynamic environments with uncertainty. This study presents a unified prediction and planning framework that concurrently models short-term aleatoric uncertainty (SAU), long-term aleatoric uncertainty (LAU), and epistemic uncertainty (EU) to predict and establish a robust foundation for planning in dynamic contexts. The framework uses Gaussian mixture models and deep ensemble methods, to concurrently capture and assess SAU, LAU, and EU, where traditional methods do not integrate these uncertainties simultaneously. Additionally, uncertainty-aware planning is introduced, considering various uncertainties. The study's contributions include comparisons of uncertainty estimations, risk modeling, and planning methods in comparison to existing approaches. The proposed methods were rigorously evaluated using the CommonRoad benchmark and settings with limited perception. These experiments illuminated the advantages and roles of different uncertainty factors in autonomous driving processes. In addition, comparative assessments of various uncertainty modeling strategies underscore the benefits of modeling multiple types of uncertainties, thus enhancing planning accuracy and reliability. The proposed framework facilitates the development of methods for UAP and surpasses existing uncertainty-aware risk models, particularly when considering diverse traffic scenarios.

|**2024-03-04**|**Depth-Guided Robust and Fast Point Cloud Fusion NeRF for Sparse Input Views**|Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view, characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines. et.al.|[2403.02063](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02063)|null|
|**2024-03-02**|**On the Road to Portability: Compressing End-to-End Motion Planner for Autonomous Driving**|End-to-end motion planning models equipped with deep neural networks have shown great potential for enabling full autonomous driving. However, the oversized neural networks render them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained systems, which unavoidably requires more computational time and resources during reference.To handle this, knowledge distillation offers a promising approach that compresses models by enabling a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model. Nevertheless, how to apply knowledge distillation to compress motion planners has not been explored so far. In this paper, we propose PlanKD, the first knowledge distillation framework tailored for compressing end-to-end motion planners. First, considering that driving scenes are inherently complex, often containing planning-irrelevant or even noisy information, transferring such information is not beneficial for the student planner. Thus, we design an information bottleneck based strategy to only distill planning-relevant information, rather than transfer all information indiscriminately. Second, different waypoints in an output planned trajectory may hold varying degrees of importance for motion planning, where a slight deviation in certain crucial waypoints might lead to a collision. Therefore, we devise a safety-aware waypoint-attentive distillation module that assigns adaptive weights to different waypoints based on the importance, to encourage the student to accurately mimic more crucial waypoints, thereby improving overall safety. Experiments demonstrate that our PlanKD can boost the performance of smaller planners by a large margin, and significantly reduce their reference time. et.al.|[2403.01238](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01238)|null|
|**2024-03-02**|**Results and Lessons Learned from Autonomous Driving Transportation Services in Airfield, Crowded Indoor, and Urban Environments**|Autonomous vehicles have been actively investigated over the past few decades. Several recent works show the potential of autonomous driving transportation services in urban environments with impressive experimental results. However, these works note that autonomous vehicles are still occasionally inferior to expert drivers in complex scenarios. Furthermore, they do not focus on the possibilities of autonomous driving transportation services in other areas beyond urban environments. This paper presents the research results and lessons learned from autonomous driving transportation services in airfield, crowded indoor, and urban environments. We discuss how we address several unique challenges in these diverse environments. We also offer an overview of remaining challenges that have not received much attention but must be addressed.

|**2024-03-01**|**Safe Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision and Control for Discretionary Lane Change**|Autonomous lane-change, a key feature of advanced driver-assistance systems, can enhance traffic efficiency and reduce the incidence of accidents. However, safe driving of autonomous vehicles remains challenging in complex environments. How to perform safe and appropriate lane change is a popular topic of research in the field of autonomous driving. Currently, few papers consider the safety of reinforcement learning in autonomous lane-change scenarios. We introduce safe hybrid-action reinforcement learning into discretionary lane change for the first time and propose Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic with PID Lagrangian (PASAC-PIDLag) algorithm. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of the Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic (PASAC), which is an unsafe version of PASAC-PIDLag. Both algorithms are employed to train the lane-change strategy of autonomous vehicles to output discrete lane-change decision and longitudinal vehicle acceleration. Our simulation results indicate that at a traffic density of 15 vehicles per kilometer (15 veh/km), the PASAC-PIDLag algorithm exhibits superior safety with a collision rate of 0%, outperforming the PASAC algorithm, which has a collision rate of 1%. The outcomes of the generalization assessments reveal that at low traffic density levels, both the PASAC-PIDLag and PASAC algorithms are proficient in attaining a 0% collision rate. Under conditions of high traffic flow density, the PASAC-PIDLag algorithm surpasses PASAC in terms of both safety and optimality. et.al.|[2403.00446](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00446)|null|
|**2024-03-01**|**MS-Net: A Multi-Path Sparse Model for Motion Prediction in Multi-Scenes**|The multi-modality and stochastic characteristics of human behavior make motion prediction a highly challenging task, which is critical for autonomous driving. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated their great potential in this area, it still remains unsolved to establish a connection between multiple driving scenes (e.g., merging, roundabout, intersection) and the design of deep learning models. Current learning-based methods typically use one unified model to predict trajectories in different scenarios, which may result in sub-optimal results for one individual scene. To address this issue, we propose Multi-Scenes Network (aka. MS-Net), which is a multi-path sparse model trained by an evolutionary process. MS-Net selectively activates a subset of its parameters during the inference stage to produce prediction results for each scene. In the training stage, the motion prediction task under differentiated scenes is abstracted as a multi-task learning problem, an evolutionary algorithm is designed to encourage the network search of the optimal parameters for each scene while sharing common knowledge between different scenes. Our experiment results show that with substantially reduced parameters, MS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on well-established pedestrian motion prediction datasets, e.g., ETH and UCY, and ranks the 2nd place on the INTERACTION challenge. et.al.|[2403.00353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00353)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots**|Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time. et.al.|[2402.19410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19410)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**Towards Safe and Reliable Autonomous Driving: Dynamic Occupancy Set Prediction**|In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction is pivotal for vehicular safety.

This method effectively combines advanced trajectory prediction networks with a DOS prediction module, overcoming the shortcomings of existing models. It provides a comprehensive and adaptable framework for predicting the potential occupancy sets of traffic participants. The main contributions of this research include: 1) A novel DOS prediction model tailored for complex scenarios, augmenting traditional trajectory prediction; 2) The development of unique DOS representations and evaluation metrics; 3) Extensive validation through experiments, demonstrating enhanced performance and adaptability.

|**2024-03-03**|**RoadRunner - Learning Traversability Estimation for Autonomous Off-road Driving**|Autonomous navigation at high speeds in off-road environments necessitates robots to comprehensively understand their surroundings using onboard sensing only. The extreme conditions posed by the off-road setting can cause degraded camera image quality due to poor lighting and motion blur, as well as limited sparse geometric information available from LiDAR sensing when driving at high speeds. In this work, we present RoadRunner, a novel framework capable of predicting terrain traversability and an elevation map directly from camera and LiDAR sensor inputs. RoadRunner enables reliable autonomous navigation, by fusing sensory information, handling of uncertainty, and generation of contextually informed predictions about the geometry and traversability of the terrain while operating at low latency. In contrast to existing methods relying on classifying handcrafted semantic classes and using heuristics to predict traversability costs, our method is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion. The RoadRunner network architecture builds upon popular sensor fusion network architectures from the autonomous driving domain, which embed LiDAR and camera information into a common Bird's Eye View perspective. Training is enabled by utilizing an existing traversability estimation stack to generate training data in hindsight in a scalable manner from real-world off-road driving datasets. Furthermore, RoadRunner improves the system latency by a factor of roughly 4, from 500 ms to 140 ms, while improving the accuracy for traversability costs and elevation map predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoadRunner in enabling safe and reliable off-road navigation at high speeds in multiple real-world driving scenarios through unstructured desert environments. et.al.|[2402.19341](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19341)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**StiefelGen: A Simple, Model Agnostic Approach for Time Series Data Augmentation over Riemannian Manifolds**|Data augmentation is an area of research which has seen active development in many machine learning fields, such as in image-based learning models, reinforcement learning for self driving vehicles, and general noise injection for point cloud data. However, convincing methods for general time series data augmentation still leaves much to be desired, especially since the methods developed for these models do not readily cross-over. Three common approaches for time series data augmentation include: (i) Constructing a physics-based model and then imbuing uncertainty over the coefficient space (for example), (ii) Adding noise to the observed data set(s), and, (iii) Having access to ample amounts of time series data sets from which a robust generative neural network model can be trained. However, for many practical problems that work with time series data in the industry: (i) One usually does not have access to a robust physical model, (ii) The addition of noise can in of itself require large or difficult assumptions (for example, what probability distribution should be used? Or, how large should the noise variance be?), and, (iii) In practice, it can be difficult to source a large representative time series data base with which to train the neural network model for the underlying problem. In this paper, we propose a methodology which attempts to simultaneously tackle all three of these previous limitations to a large extent. The method relies upon the well-studied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold, as it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on, and then smoothly perturbed over the manifold. We attempt to clarify how this method works by showcasing several potential use cases which in particular work to take advantage of the unique properties of this underlying manifold. et.al.|[2402.19287](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19287)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**T3DNet: Compressing Point Cloud Models for Lightweight 3D Recognition**|3D point cloud has been widely used in many mobile application scenarios, including autonomous driving and 3D sensing on mobile devices. However, existing 3D point cloud models tend to be large and cumbersome, making them hard to deploy on edged devices due to their high memory requirements and non-real-time latency. There has been a lack of research on how to compress 3D point cloud models into lightweight models. In this paper, we propose a method called T3DNet (Tiny 3D Network with augmEntation and disTillation) to address this issue. We find that the tiny model after network augmentation is much easier for a teacher to distill. Instead of gradually reducing the parameters through techniques such as pruning or quantization, we pre-define a tiny model and improve its performance through auxiliary supervision from augmented networks and the original model. We evaluate our method on several public datasets, including ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanObjectNN. Our method can achieve high compression rates without significant accuracy sacrifice, achieving state-of-the-art performances on three datasets against existing methods. Amazingly, our T3DNet is 58 times smaller and 54 times faster than the original model yet with only 1.4% accuracy descent on the ModelNet40 dataset. et.al.|[2402.19264](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19264)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**A Cognitive-Based Trajectory Prediction Approach for Autonomous Driving**|In autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, the ability to accurately predict the movements of surrounding vehicles is paramount for ensuring safety and operational efficiency. Incorporating human decision-making insights enables AVs to more effectively anticipate the potential actions of other vehicles, significantly improving prediction accuracy and responsiveness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction (HLTP) model, which adopts a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework inspired by human cognitive processes. The HLTP model incorporates a sophisticated teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model, equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the visual processing of the human brain, particularly the functions of the occipital and temporal lobes. The "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and decision-making, drawing parallels to prefrontal and parietal cortex functions. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation to changing driving scenarios, capturing essential perceptual cues for accurate prediction. Evaluated using the Macao Connected and Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset, along with the NGSIM and HighD benchmarks, HLTP demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, particularly in challenging environments with incomplete data.

Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources (e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse, a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving.

|**2024-02-29**|**GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction**|Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset. et.al.|[2402.19002](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002)|null|

|**2024-02-28**|**Evaluating Decision Optimality of Autonomous Driving via Metamorphic Testing**|Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is equally vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing ADSs' optimal decision-making performance due to the lack of corresponding oracles and the difficulty in generating scenarios with non-optimal decisions. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the decision-making quality of an ADS and propose the first method for detecting non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not compute optimal paths for AVs. Firstly, to deal with the oracle problem, we propose a novel metamorphic relation (MR) aimed at exposing violations of optimal decisions. The MR identifies the property that the ADS should retain optimal decisions when the optimal path remains unaffected by non-invasive changes. Subsequently, we develop a new framework, Decictor, designed to generate NoDSs efficiently. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, MR Check, and Feedback. The Non-invasive Mutation ensures that the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios is not affected, while the MR Check is responsible for determining whether non-optimal decisions are made. To enhance the effectiveness of identifying NoDSs, we design a feedback metric that combines both spatial and temporal aspects of the AV's movement. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal decisions of ADSs. Our work provides valuable and original insights into evaluating the non-safety-critical performance of ADSs. et.al.|[2402.18393](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18393)|null|

Frequently, trees or other vegetation is growing above the roads, blocking the sight of traffic signs and lights and posing danger to traffic participants. Accurately estimating this space from simple images proves challenging due to a lack of depth information. This is where LiDAR technology comes into play, a laser scanning sensor that reveals a three-dimensional perspective. Thus far, LiDAR point clouds at the street level have mainly been used for applications in the field of autonomous driving. These scans, however, also open up possibilities in urban management. In this paper, we present a new point cloud algorithm that can automatically detect those parts of the trees that grow over the street and need to be trimmed. Our system uses semantic segmentation to filter relevant points and downstream processing steps to create the required volume to be kept clear above the road. Challenges include obscured stretches of road, the noisy unstructured nature of LiDAR point clouds, and the assessment of the road shape. The identified points of non-compliant trees can be projected from the point cloud onto images, providing municipalities with a visual aid for dealing with such occurrences. By automating this process, municipalities can address potential road space constraints, enhancing safety for all. They may also save valuable time by carrying out the inspections more systematically. Our open-source code gives communities inspiration on how to automate the process themselves. et.al.|[2402.18309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18309)|null|

Due to the lack of semantic modeling capacity in audio and video, existing works have mainly focused on text-based multi-object tracking, which often comes at the cost of tracking quality, interaction efficiency, and even the safety of assistance systems, limiting the application of such methods in autonomous driving. In this paper, we delve into the problem of AR-MOT from the perspective of audio-video fusion and audio-video tracking. We put forward EchoTrack, an end-to-end AR-MOT framework with dual-stream vision transformers. The dual streams are intertwined with our Bidirectional Frequency-domain Cross-attention Fusion Module (Bi-FCFM), which bidirectionally fuses audio and video features from both frequency- and spatiotemporal domains.

Non-neighborhood central anchors effectively assist the neighborhood central anchors in fitting to the target points, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. Then, we introduce grouped local self-attention (GL-SA), which innovatively utilizes local queries as the medium for feature interaction, thereby substantially reducing the computational complexity of self-attention while facilitating ample feature interaction among queries.

Particularly, in the field of autonomous driving, the visual perception ability of RGB sensors experiences a sharp decline in such harsh scenarios. Additionally, driving assistance systems suffer from reduced capabilities in capturing and discerning the surrounding environment, posing a threat to driving safety. Single-view information captured by single-modal sensors cannot comprehensively depict the entire scene. To address these challenges, we developed an image de-raining framework tailored for rainy nighttime driving scenes. It aims to remove rain artifacts, enrich scene representation, and restore useful information. Specifically, we introduce cooperative learning between visible and infrared images captured by different sensors. By cross-view fusion of these multi-source data, the scene within the images gains richer texture details and enhanced contrast. We constructed an information cleaning module called CleanNet as the first stage of our framework. Moreover, we designed an information fusion module called FusionNet as the second stage to fuse the clean visible images with infrared images. Using this stage-by-stage learning strategy, we obtain de-rained fusion images with higher quality and better visual perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Cross-View Cooperative Learning (CVCL) in adverse driving scenarios in low-light rainy environments. The proposed approach addresses the gap in the utilization of existing rain removal algorithms in specific low-light conditions. et.al.|[2402.18172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18172)|**[link](https://github.com/cidanshi/nitedr-nighttime-image-de-raining)**|
|**2024-02-28**|**3DSFLabelling: Boosting 3D Scene Flow Estimation by Pseudo Auto-labelling**|Learning 3D scene flow from LiDAR point clouds presents significant difficulties, including poor generalization from synthetic datasets to real scenes, scarcity of real-world 3D labels, and poor performance on real sparse LiDAR point clouds. We present a novel approach from the perspective of auto-labelling, aiming to generate a large number of 3D scene flow pseudo labels for real-world LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, we employ the assumption of rigid body motion to simulate potential object-level rigid movements in autonomous driving scenarios. By updating different motion attributes for multiple anchor boxes, the rigid motion decomposition is obtained for the whole scene. Furthermore, we developed a novel 3D scene flow data augmentation method for global and local motion. By perfectly synthesizing target point clouds based on augmented motion parameters, we easily obtain lots of 3D scene flow labels in point clouds highly consistent with real scenarios. On multiple real-world datasets including LiDAR KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse, our method outperforms all previous supervised and unsupervised methods without requiring manual labelling. Impressively, our method achieves a tenfold reduction in EPE3D metric on the LiDAR KITTI dataset, reducing it from $0.190m$ to a mere $0.008m$ error. et.al.|[2402.18146](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18146)|**[link](https://github.com/jiangchaokang/3dsflabelling)**|

Our method builds upon the strong baseline BEVFormer and improves its performance through several simple yet effective techniques. Firstly, we employed data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability. Secondly, we used a strong image backbone to extract more informative features from the input data. Thirdly, we incorporated a 3D unet head to better capture the spatial information of the scene. Fourthly, we added more loss functions to better optimize the model. Additionally, we used an ensemble approach with the occ model BevDet and SurroundOcc to further improve the performance. Most importantly, we integrated 3D detection model StreamPETR to enhance the model's ability to detect objects in the scene. Using these methods, our solution achieved 49.23 miou on the 3D occupancy prediction track in the autonomous driving challenge. et.al.|[2402.18140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18140)|null|
|**2024-02-28**|**Passive Snapshot Coded Aperture Dual-Pixel RGB-D Imaging**|Passive, compact, single-shot 3D sensing is useful in many application areas such as microscopy, medical imaging, surgical navigation, and autonomous driving where form factor, time, and power constraints can exist. Obtaining RGB-D scene information over a short imaging distance, in an ultra-compact form factor, and in a passive, snapshot manner is challenging. Dual-pixel (DP) sensors are a potential solution to achieve the same. DP sensors collect light rays from two different halves of the lens in two interleaved pixel arrays, thus capturing two slightly different views of the scene, like a stereo camera system. However, imaging with a DP sensor implies that the defocus blur size is directly proportional to the disparity seen between the views. This creates a trade-off between disparity estimation vs. deblurring accuracy. To improve this trade-off effect, we propose CADS (Coded Aperture Dual-Pixel Sensing), in which we use a coded aperture in the imaging lens along with a DP sensor. In our approach, we jointly learn an optimal coded pattern and the reconstruction algorithm in an end-to-end optimization setting. Our resulting CADS imaging system demonstrates improvement of $>$ 1.5dB PSNR in all-in-focus (AIF) estimates and 5-6% in depth estimation quality over naive DP sensing for a wide range of aperture settings. Furthermore, we build the proposed CADS prototypes for DSLR photography settings and in an endoscope and a dermoscope form factor. Our novel coded dual-pixel sensing approach demonstrates accurate RGB-D reconstruction results in simulations and real-world experiments in a passive, snapshot, and compact manner. et.al.|[2402.18102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18102)|null|

Addressing these limitations, we introduce the Indoor Connected Autonomous Testbed (ICAT), a platform that not only tackles the unique challenges of indoor autonomous driving but also innovates vehicle computing and V2X communication.

These and other use cases often rely on specific quality of service (QoS) levels for communication. Recently, the area of predictive quality of service (QoS) has received a great deal of attention as a key enabler to forecast communication quality well enough in advance. However, predicting QoS in a reliable manner is a notoriously difficult task. In this paper, we evaluate ML tree-ensemble methods to predict QoS in the range of minutes with data collected from a cellular test network. We discuss radio environment characteristics and we showcase how these can be used to improve ML performance and further support the uptake of ML in commercial networks. Specifically, we use the correlations of the measurements coming from the radio environment by including information of prior vehicles to enhance the prediction of the target vehicles. Moreover, we are extending prior art by showing how longer prediction horizons can be supported. et.al.|[2402.17689](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17689)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**Mitigating Distributional Shift in Semantic Segmentation via Uncertainty Estimation from Unlabelled Data**|Knowing when a trained segmentation model is encountering data that is different to its training data is important. Understanding and mitigating the effects of this play an important part in their application from a performance and assurance perspective - this being a safety concern in applications such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). This work presents a segmentation network that can detect errors caused by challenging test domains without any additional annotation in a single forward pass. As annotation costs limit the diversity of labelled datasets, we use easy-to-obtain, uncurated and unlabelled data to learn to perform uncertainty estimation by selectively enforcing consistency over data augmentation. To this end, a novel segmentation benchmark based on the SAX Dataset is used, which includes labelled test data spanning three autonomous-driving domains, ranging in appearance from dense urban to off-road. The proposed method, named Gamma-SSL, consistently outperforms uncertainty estimation and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) techniques on this difficult benchmark - by up to 10.7% in area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and 19.2% in area under the precision-recall (PR) curve in the most challenging of the three scenarios. et.al.|[2402.17653](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17653)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**An Empirical Study of the Generalization Ability of Lidar 3D Object Detectors to Unseen Domains**|3D Object Detectors (3D-OD) are crucial for understanding the environment in many robotic tasks, especially autonomous driving. Including 3D information via Lidar sensors improves accuracy greatly. However, such detectors perform poorly on domains they were not trained on, i.e. different locations, sensors, weather, etc., limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. There exist methods to adapt 3D-ODs to these domains; however, these methods treat 3D-ODs as a black box, neglecting underlying architectural decisions and source-domain training strategies. Instead, we dive deep into the details of 3D-ODs, focusing our efforts on fundamental factors that influence robustness prior to domain adaptation.   We systematically investigate four design choices (and the interplay between them) often overlooked in 3D-OD robustness and domain adaptation: architecture, voxel encoding, data augmentations, and anchor strategies. We assess their impact on the robustness of nine state-of-the-art 3D-ODs across six benchmarks encompassing three types of domain gaps - sensor type, weather, and location.   Our main findings are: (1) transformer backbones with local point features are more robust than 3D CNNs, (2) test-time anchor size adjustment is crucial for adaptation across geographical locations, significantly boosting scores without retraining, (3) source-domain augmentations allow the model to generalize to low-resolution sensors, and (4) surprisingly, robustness to bad weather is improved when training directly on more clean weather data than on training with bad weather data. We outline our main conclusions and findings to provide practical guidance on developing more robust 3D-ODs. et.al.|[2402.17562](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17562)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**Leveraging Enhanced Queries of Point Sets for Vectorized Map Construction**|In autonomous driving, the high-definition (HD) map plays a crucial role in localization and planning. Recently, several methods have facilitated end-to-end online map construction in DETR-like frameworks. However, little attention has been paid to the potential capabilities of exploring the query mechanism. This paper introduces MapQR, an end-to-end method with an emphasis on enhancing query capabilities for constructing online vectorized maps. Although the map construction is essentially a point set prediction task, MapQR utilizes instance queries rather than point queries. These instance queries are scattered for the prediction of point sets and subsequently gathered for the final matching. This query design, called the scatter-and-gather query, shares content information in the same map element and avoids possible inconsistency of content information in point queries. We further exploit prior information to enhance an instance query by adding positional information embedded from their reference points. Together with a simple and effective improvement of a BEV encoder, the proposed MapQR achieves the best mean average precision (mAP) and maintains good efficiency on both nuScenes and Argoverse 2. In addition, integrating our query design into other models can boost their performance significantly. The code will be available at https://github.com/HXMap/MapQR. et.al.|[2402.17430](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17430)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**ICP-Flow: LiDAR Scene Flow Estimation with ICP**|Scene flow characterizes the 3D motion between two LiDAR scans captured by an autonomous vehicle at nearby timesteps. Prevalent methods consider scene flow as point-wise unconstrained flow vectors that can be learned by either large-scale training beforehand or time-consuming optimization at inference. However, these methods do not take into account that objects in autonomous driving often move rigidly. We incorporate this rigid-motion assumption into our design, where the goal is to associate objects over scans and then estimate the locally rigid transformations. We propose ICP-Flow, a learning-free flow estimator. The core of our design is the conventional Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which aligns the objects over time and outputs the corresponding rigid transformations. Crucially, to aid ICP, we propose a histogram-based initialization that discovers the most likely translation, thus providing a good starting point for ICP. The complete scene flow is then recovered from the rigid transformations. We outperform state-of-the-art baselines, including supervised models, on the Waymo dataset and perform competitively on Argoverse-v2 and nuScenes. Further, we train a feedforward neural network, supervised by the pseudo labels from our model, and achieve top performance among all models capable of real-time inference. We validate the advantage of our model on scene flow estimation with longer temporal gaps, up to 0.5 seconds where other models fail to deliver meaningful results. et.al.|[2402.17351](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17351)|null|
|**2024-02-27**|**Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making**|Both text and video data are abundant on the internet and support large-scale self-supervised learning through next token or frame prediction. However, they have not been equally leveraged: language models have had significant real-world impact, whereas video generation has remained largely limited to media entertainment. Yet video data captures important information about the physical world that is difficult to express in language. To address this gap, we discuss an under-appreciated opportunity to extend video generation to solve tasks in the real world. We observe how, akin to language, video can serve as a unified interface that can absorb internet knowledge and represent diverse tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how, like language models, video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators through techniques such as in-context learning, planning and reinforcement learning. We identify major impact opportunities in domains such as robotics, self-driving, and science, supported by recent work that demonstrates how such advanced capabilities in video generation are plausibly within reach. Lastly, we identify key challenges in video generation that mitigate progress. Addressing these challenges will enable video generation models to demonstrate unique value alongside language models in a wider array of AI applications. et.al.|[2402.17139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17139)|null|

|**2024-02-26**|**Think2Drive: Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Thinking in Latent World Model for Quasi-Realistic Autonomous Driving (in CARLA-v2)**|Real-world autonomous driving (AD) especially urban driving involves many corner cases. The lately released AD simulator CARLA v2 adds 39 common events in the driving scene, and provide more quasi-realistic testbed compared to CARLA v1. It poses new challenge to the community and so far no literature has reported any success on the new scenarios in V2 as existing works mostly have to rely on specific rules for planning yet they cannot cover the more complex cases in CARLA v2. In this work, we take the initiative of directly training a planner and the hope is to handle the corner cases flexibly and effectively, which we believe is also the future of AD. To our best knowledge, we develop the first model-based RL method named Think2Drive for AD, with a world model to learn the transitions of the environment, and then it acts as a neural simulator to train the planner. This paradigm significantly boosts the training efficiency due to the low dimensional state space and parallel computing of tensors in the world model. As a result, Think2Drive is able to run in an expert-level proficiency in CARLA v2 within 3 days of training on a single A6000 GPU, and to our best knowledge, so far there is no reported success (100\% route completion)on CARLA v2. We also propose CornerCase-Repository, a benchmark that supports the evaluation of driving models by scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new and balanced metric to evaluate the performance by route completion, infraction number, and scenario density, so that the driving score could give more information about the actual driving performance. et.al.|[2402.16720](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16720)|null|

We propose a data-efficient method for online and on-the-fly learning based adaptation for parametrizable control architectures such that the target closed-loop performance is optimized under several uncertainty sources such as model mismatches, environment changes and task choice. The novelty of the work resides in leveraging black-box optimization enabled by executable digital twins, with data-driven hyper-parameter tuning through derivative-free methods to directly adapt in real-time the AD module. Our proposed method requires a minimal amount of interaction with the real-world in the randomization and online training phase. Specifically, we validate our approach in real-world experiments and show the ability to transfer and safely tune a nonlinear model predictive controller in less than 10 minutes, eliminating the need of day-long manual tuning and hours-long machine learning training phases. Our results show that the online adapted NMPC directly compensates for disturbances, avoids overtuning in simulation and for one specific task, and it generalizes for less than 15cm of tracking accuracy over a multitude of trajectories, and leads to 83% tracking improvement. et.al.|[2402.16645](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16645)|null|

|**2024-02-26**|**Edge Detectors Can Make Deep Convolutional Neural Networks More Robust**|Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN for short) are vulnerable to examples with small perturbations. Improving DCNN's robustness is of great significance to the safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and industry automation. Inspired by the principal way that human eyes recognize objects, i.e., largely relying on the shape features, this paper first employs the edge detectors as layer kernels and designs a binary edge feature branch (BEFB for short) to learn the binary edge features, which can be easily integrated into any popular backbone. The four edge detectors can learn the horizontal, vertical, positive diagonal, and negative diagonal edge features, respectively, and the branch is stacked by multiple Sobel layers (using edge detectors as kernels) and one threshold layer. The binary edge features learned by the branch, concatenated with the texture features learned by the backbone, are fed into the fully connected layers for classification. We integrate the proposed branch into VGG16 and ResNet34, respectively, and conduct experiments on multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the BEFB is lightweight and has no side effects on training. And the accuracy of the BEFB integrated models is better than the original ones on all datasets when facing FGSM, PGD, and C\&W attacks. Besides, BEFB integrated models equipped with the robustness enhancing techniques can achieve better classification accuracy compared to the original models. The work in this paper for the first time shows it is feasible to enhance the robustness of DCNNs through combining both shape-like features and texture features. et.al.|[2402.16479](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16479)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**SeqTrack3D: Exploring Sequence Information for Robust 3D Point Cloud Tracking**|3D single object tracking (SOT) is an important and challenging task for the autonomous driving and mobile robotics. Most existing methods perform tracking between two consecutive frames while ignoring the motion patterns of the target over a series of frames, which would cause performance degradation in the scenes with sparse points. To break through this limitation, we introduce Sequence-to-Sequence tracking paradigm and a tracker named SeqTrack3D to capture target motion across continuous frames. Unlike previous methods that primarily adopted three strategies: matching two consecutive point clouds, predicting relative motion, or utilizing sequential point clouds to address feature degradation, our SeqTrack3D combines both historical point clouds and bounding box sequences. This novel method ensures robust tracking by leveraging location priors from historical boxes, even in scenes with sparse points. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets show that SeqTrack3D achieves new state-of-the-art performances, improving by 6.00% on NuScenes and 14.13% on Waymo dataset.

|**2024-02-25**|**Machine Learning-Based Vehicle Intention Trajectory Recognition and Prediction for Autonomous Driving**|In recent years, the expansion of internet technology and advancements in automation have brought significant attention to autonomous driving technology. Major automobile manufacturers, including Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla, have progressively introduced products ranging from assisted-driving vehicles to semi-autonomous vehicles. However, this period has also witnessed several traffic safety incidents involving self-driving vehicles. For instance, in March 2016, a Google self-driving car was involved in a minor collision with a bus. At the time of the accident, the autonomous vehicle was attempting to merge into the right lane but failed to dynamically respond to the real-time environmental information during the lane change. It incorrectly assumed that the approaching bus would slow down to avoid it, leading to a low-speed collision with the bus. This incident highlights the current technological shortcomings and safety concerns associated with autonomous lane-changing behavior, despite the rapid advancements in autonomous driving technology. Lane-changing is among the most common and hazardous behaviors in highway driving, significantly impacting traffic safety and flow. Therefore, lane-changing is crucial for traffic safety, and accurately predicting drivers' lane change intentions can markedly enhance driving safety. This paper introduces a deep learning-based prediction method for autonomous driving lane change behavior, aiming to facilitate safe lane changes and thereby improve road safety. et.al.|[2402.16036](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16036)|null|

High-precision map technology is an important guarantee for intelligent vehicles to achieve autonomous driving. However, due to the lack of research on high-precision map technology, it is difficult to rationally use this technology in the field of intelligent vehicles. Therefore, relevant researchers studied a fast and effective algorithm to generate high-precision GPS data from a large number of low-precision GPS trajectory data fusion, and generated several key data points to simplify the description of GPS trajectory, and realized the "crowdsourced update" model based on a large number of social vehicles for map data collection came into being. This kind of algorithm has the important significance to improve the data accuracy, reduce the measurement cost and reduce the data storage space. On this basis, this paper analyzes the implementation form of crowdsourcing map, so as to improve the various information data in the high-precision map according to the actual situation, and promote the high-precision map can be reasonably applied to the intelligent car. et.al.|[2402.15796](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15796)|null|

Autonomous lane change plays a pivotal role in improving traffic flow, alleviating driver burden, and reducing the risk of traffic accidents. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of lane-change scenarios, the functionality of autonomous lane change still faces challenges. In this research, we conduct autonomous lane-change simulations using both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Specifically, we propose the Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic (PASAC) algorithm to train a DRL-based lane-change strategy to output both discrete lane-change decision and continuous longitudinal vehicle acceleration. We also use MPC for lane selection based on predictive car-following costs for different lanes. For the first time, we compare the performance of DRL and MPC in the context of lane-change decision. Simulation results indicate that, under the same reward/cost functions and traffic flow, both MPC and PASAC achieve a collision rate of 0\%. PASAC demonstrates comparable performance to MPC in terms of episodic rewards/costs and average vehicle speeds. et.al.|[2402.15790](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15790)|null|
|**2024-02-24**|**Detection Is Tracking: Point Cloud Multi-Sweep Deep Learning Models Revisited**|Conventional tracking paradigm takes in instantaneous measurements such as range and bearing, and produces object tracks across time. In applications such as autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are usually passed through a "virtual sensor" realized by a deep learning model, to produce "measurements" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a tracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We argue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information, and therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal information, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the end of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called MULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object, a pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the input buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly used lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the resulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not only to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct more sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by the pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death models. We have conducted preliminary training and experimentation using Waymo Open Dataset, which shows the efficacy of our proposed method. et.al.|[2402.15756](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15756)|null|

We benchmark Objective Suppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous driving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous consequences. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL algorithms, can match the task reward achieved by our baselines with significantly fewer constraint violations. et.al.|[2402.15650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15650)|null|
|**2024-02-23**|**Distilling Adversarial Robustness Using Heterogeneous Teachers**|Achieving resiliency against adversarial attacks is necessary prior to deploying neural network classifiers in domains where misclassification incurs substantial costs, e.g., self-driving cars or medical imaging. Recent work has demonstrated that robustness can be transferred from an adversarially trained teacher to a student model using knowledge distillation. However, current methods perform distillation using a single adversarial and vanilla teacher and consider homogeneous architectures (i.e., residual networks) that are susceptible to misclassify examples from similar adversarial subspaces. In this work, we develop a defense framework against adversarial attacks by distilling adversarial robustness using heterogeneous teachers (DARHT). In DARHT, the student model explicitly represents teacher logits in a student-teacher feature map and leverages multiple teachers that exhibit low adversarial example transferability (i.e., exhibit high performance on dissimilar adversarial examples). Experiments on classification tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios demonstrate that DARHT achieves state-of-the-art clean and robust accuracies when compared to competing adversarial training and distillation methods in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Comparisons with homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher sets suggest that leveraging teachers with low adversarial example transferability increases student model robustness. et.al.|[2402.15586](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15586)|null|
|**2024-02-23**|**Cohere3D: Exploiting Temporal Coherence for Unsupervised Representation Learning of Vision-based Autonomous Driving**|Due to the lack of depth cues in images, multi-frame inputs are important for the success of vision-based perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving. Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D image inputs if we can identify the same instance in different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of autonomous driving scenes leads to significant changes in the appearance and shape of each instance captured by the camera at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance representations in a long-term input sequence robust to the change in distance and perspective. The learned representation aids in instance-level correspondence across multiple input frames in downstream tasks. In the pretraining stage, the raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the long-term temporal correspondence for each instance, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level representation from the vision-based bird's eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages a consistent representation for the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between representations of different instances. We evaluate our algorithm by finetuning the pretrained model on various downstream perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Results show a notable improvement in both data efficiency and task performance. et.al.|[2402.15583](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15583)|null|

Currently, two major challenges persist in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection: $1)$ inherent pose errors when fusing multi-view images, caused by time asynchrony across cameras; $2)$ information loss in transmission process resulted from limited communication bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose a novel camera-based 3D detection framework for VIC3D task, Enhanced Multi-scale Image Feature Fusion (EMIFF). To fully exploit holistic perspectives from both vehicles and infrastructure, we propose Multi-scale Cross Attention (MCA) and Camera-aware Channel Masking (CCM) modules to enhance infrastructure and vehicle features at scale, spatial, and channel levels to correct the pose error introduced by camera asynchrony. We also introduce a Feature Compression (FC) module with channel and spatial compression blocks for transmission efficiency.

|**2024-02-22**|**Path Planning based on 2D Object Bounding-box**|The implementation of Autonomous Driving (AD) technologies within urban environments presents significant challenges. These challenges necessitate the development of advanced perception systems and motion planning algorithms capable of managing situations of considerable complexity. Although the end-to-end AD method utilizing LiDAR sensors has achieved significant success in this scenario, we argue that its drawbacks may hinder its practical application. Instead, we propose the vision-centric AD as a promising alternative offering a streamlined model without compromising performance. In this study, we present a path planning method that utilizes 2D bounding boxes of objects, developed through imitation learning in urban driving scenarios. This is achieved by integrating high-definition (HD) map data with images captured by surrounding cameras. Subsequent perception tasks involve bounding-box detection and tracking, while the planning phase employs both local embeddings via Graph Neural Network (GNN) and global embeddings via Transformer for temporal-spatial feature aggregation, ultimately producing optimal path planning information. We evaluated our model on the nuPlan planning task and observed that it performs competitively in comparison to existing vision-centric methods. et.al.|[2402.14933](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14933)|null|
|**2024-02-22**|**Distributed Radiance Fields for Edge Video Compression and Metaverse Integration in Autonomous Driving**|The metaverse is a virtual space that combines physical and digital elements, creating immersive and connected digital worlds. For autonomous mobility, it enables new possibilities with edge computing and digital twins (DTs) that offer virtual prototyping, prediction, and more. DTs can be created with 3D scene reconstruction methods that capture the real world's geometry, appearance, and dynamics. However, sending data for real-time DT updates in the metaverse, such as camera images and videos from connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to edge servers, can increase network congestion, costs, and latency, affecting metaverse services. Herein, a new method is proposed based on distributed radiance fields (RFs), multi-access edge computing (MEC) network for video compression and metaverse DT updates. RF-based encoder and decoder are used to create and restore representations of camera images. The method is evaluated on a dataset of camera images from the CARLA simulator. Data savings of up to 80% were achieved for H.264 I-frame - P-frame pairs by using RFs instead of I-frames, while maintaining high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) qualitative metrics for the reconstructed images. Possible uses and challenges for the metaverse and autonomous mobility are also discussed. et.al.|[2402.14642](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14642)|null|

Networks of multiple interdependent and interacting humans and autonomous machines constitute complex adaptive social systems where the collective outcomes cannot be simply deduced from either human or machine behavior alone. Under this paradigm, we review recent experimental, theoretical, and observational research from across a range of disciplines - robotics, human-computer interaction, web science, complexity science, computational social science, finance, economics, political science, social psychology, and sociology. We identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion, and collective decision-making, and contextualize them in four prominent existing human-machine communities: high-frequency trading markets, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, the open-collaboration encyclopedia Wikipedia, and the news aggregation and discussion community Reddit. We conclude with suggestions for the research, design, and governance of human-machine social systems, which are necessary to reduce misinformation, prevent financial crashes, improve road safety, overcome labor market disruptions, and enable a better human future. et.al.|[2402.14410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14410)|null|
|**2024-02-22**|**RadarMOSEVE: A Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for Radar-Only Moving Object Segmentation and Ego-Velocity Estimation**|Moving object segmentation (MOS) and Ego velocity estimation (EVE) are vital capabilities for mobile systems to achieve full autonomy. Several approaches have attempted to achieve MOSEVE using a LiDAR sensor. However, LiDAR sensors are typically expensive and susceptible to adverse weather conditions. Instead, millimeter-wave radar (MWR) has gained popularity in robotics and autonomous driving for real applications due to its cost-effectiveness and resilience to bad weather. Nonetheless, publicly available MOSEVE datasets and approaches using radar data are limited. Some existing methods adopt point convolutional networks from LiDAR-based approaches, ignoring the specific artifacts and the valuable radial velocity information of radar measurements, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer network that effectively addresses the sparsity and noise issues and leverages the radial velocity measurements of radar points using our devised radar self- and cross-attention mechanisms. Based on that, our method achieves accurate EVE of the robot and performs MOS using only radar data simultaneously. To thoroughly evaluate the MOSEVE performance of our method, we annotated the radar points in the public View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset and additionally constructed a new radar dataset in various environments. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Existing dynamic game formulations assume all agents are task-driven and behave optimally. However, in reality, humans tend to deviate from the decisions prescribed by these models, and their behavior is better approximated under a noisy-rational paradigm. In this work, we investigate a principled methodology to blend a data-driven reference policy with an optimization-based game-theoretic policy. We formulate KLGame, a type of non-cooperative dynamic game with Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization with respect to a general, stochastic, and possibly multi-modal reference policy. Our method incorporates, for each decision maker, a tunable parameter that permits modulation between task-driven and data-driven behaviors. We propose an efficient algorithm for computing multimodal approximate feedback Nash equilibrium strategies of KLGame in real time. Through a series of simulated and real-world autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate that KLGame policies can more effectively incorporate guidance from the reference policy and account for noisily-rational human behaviors versus non-regularized baselines. et.al.|[2402.14174](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14174)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**Zero-BEV: Zero-shot Projection of Any First-Person Modality to BEV Maps**|Bird's-eye view (BEV) maps are an important geometrically structured representation widely used in robotics, in particular self-driving vehicles and terrestrial robots. Existing algorithms either require depth information for the geometric projection, which is not always reliably available, or are trained end-to-end in a fully supervised way to map visual first-person observations to BEV representation, and are therefore restricted to the output modality they have been trained for. In contrast, we propose a new model capable of performing zero-shot projections of any modality available in a first person view to the corresponding BEV map. This is achieved by disentangling the geometric inverse perspective projection from the modality transformation, eg. RGB to occupancy. The method is general and we showcase experiments projecting to BEV three different modalities: semantic segmentation, motion vectors and object bounding boxes detected in first person. We experimentally show that the model outperforms competing methods, in particular the widely used baseline resorting to monocular depth estimation. et.al.|[2402.13848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13848)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**Hybrid Reasoning Based on Large Language Models for Autonomous Car Driving**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to understand text and images, generate human-like text, and perform complex reasoning tasks. However, their ability to generalize this advanced reasoning with a combination of natural language text for decision-making in dynamic situations requires further exploration. In this study, we investigate how well LLMs can adapt and apply a combination of arithmetic and common-sense reasoning, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios. We hypothesize that LLMs hybrid reasoning abilities can improve autonomous driving by enabling them to analyze detected object and sensor data, understand driving regulations and physical laws, and offer additional context. This addresses complex scenarios, like decisions in low visibility (due to weather conditions), where traditional methods might fall short. We evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) based on accuracy by comparing their answers with human-generated ground truth inside CARLA. The results showed that when a combination of images (detected objects) and sensor data is fed into the LLM, it can offer precise information for brake and throttle control in autonomous vehicles across various weather conditions. This formulation and answers can assist in decision-making for auto-pilot systems. et.al.|[2402.13602](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13602)|null|

|**2024-02-21**|**Learning to Model Diverse Driving Behaviors in Highly Interactive Autonomous Driving Scenarios with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**|Autonomous vehicles trained through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the Personality Modeling Network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization compared to traditional MARL methods. et.al.|[2402.13481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13481)|null|

With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, integrating DTs into vehicular platforms is anticipated to further revolutionize smart mobility systems. In this paper, a new smart mobility DT (SMDT) platform is proposed for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) over next-generation wireless networks. In particular, the proposed platform enables cloud services to leverage the abilities of DTs to promote the autonomous driving experience. To enhance traffic efficiency and road safety measures, a novel navigation system that exploits available DT information is designed. The SMDT platform and navigation system are implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and roadside units (RSUs), and emerging technologies, e.g., cloud and cellular V2X (C-V2X). In addition, proof-of-concept (PoC) experiments are conducted to validate system performance. The performance of SMDT is evaluated from two standpoints: (i) the rewards of the proposed navigation system on traffic efficiency and safety and, (ii) the latency and reliability of the SMDT platform. Our experimental results using SUMO-based large-scale traffic simulations show that the proposed SMDT can reduce the average travel time and the blocking probability due to unexpected traffic incidents. Furthermore, the results record a peak overall latency for DT modeling and route planning services to be 155.15 ms and 810.59 ms, respectively, which validates that our proposed design aligns with the 3GPP requirements for emerging V2X use cases and fulfills the targets of the proposed design.

End-toend strategies, emerging to simplify traditional driving systems by integrating perception, decision-making, and control, offer new avenues for advanced driving functionalities. Despite their potential, current challenges include data efficiency, training complexities, and poor generalization. This study addresses these issues with a novel end-to-end AD training model, enhancing system adaptability and intelligence. The model incorporates a Transformer module into the policy network, undergoing initial behavior cloning (BC) pre-training for update gradients. Subsequently, fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human guidance (RLHG) adapts the model to specific driving environments, aiming to surpass the performance limits of imitation learning (IL). The fine-tuning process involves human interactions, guiding the model to acquire more efficient and safer driving behaviors through supervision, intervention, demonstration, and reward feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that this framework accelerates learning, achieving precise control and significantly enhancing safety and reliability. Compared to other advanced baseline methods, the proposed approach excels in challenging AD tasks.

|**2024-02-19**|**UncertaintyTrack: Exploiting Detection and Localization Uncertainty in Multi-Object Tracking**|Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have seen a significant boost in performance recently, due to strong interest from the research community and steadily improving object detection methods. The majority of tracking methods follow the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, blindly trust the incoming detections with no sense of their associated localization uncertainty. This lack of uncertainty awareness poses a problem in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving where passengers could be put at risk due to erroneous detections that have propagated to downstream tasks, including MOT. While there are existing works in probabilistic object detection that predict the localization uncertainty around the boxes, no work in 2D MOT for autonomous driving has studied whether these estimates are meaningful enough to be leveraged effectively in object tracking. We introduce UncertaintyTrack, a collection of extensions that can be applied to multiple TBD trackers to account for localization uncertainty estimates from probabilistic object detectors. Experiments on the Berkeley Deep Drive MOT dataset show that the combination of our method and informative uncertainty estimates reduces the number of ID switches by around 19\% and improves mMOTA by 2-3%.

The automotive industry has advanced in applying state-of-the-art computer vision to enhance road safety and provide automated driving functionality. When using camera systems on vehicles, there is a particular need for a wide field of view to capture the entire vehicle's surroundings, in areas such as low-speed maneuvering, automated parking, and cocoon sensing. However, one crucial challenge in surround-view cameras is the strong optical aberrations of the fisheye camera, which is an area that has received little attention in the literature. Additionally, a comprehensive dataset is needed for testing safety-critical scenarios in vehicle automation. The industry has turned to simulation as a cost-effective strategy for creating synthetic datasets with surround-view camera imagery. We examine different simulation methods (such as model-driven and data-driven simulations) and discuss the simulators' ability (or lack thereof) to model real-world optical performance.

|**2024-02-19**|**SDGE: Stereo Guided Depth Estimation for 360° Camera Sets**|Depth estimation is a critical technology in autonomous driving, and multi-camera systems are often used to achieve a 360{\deg} perception. These 360{\deg} camera sets often have limited or low-quality overlap regions, making multi-view stereo methods infeasible for the entire image. Alternatively, monocular methods may not produce consistent cross-view predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Stereo Guided Depth Estimation (SGDE) method, which enhances depth estimation of the full image by explicitly utilizing multi-view stereo results on the overlap. We suggest building virtual pinhole cameras to resolve the distortion problem of fisheye cameras and unify the processing for the two types of 360{\deg} cameras. For handling the varying noise on camera poses caused by unstable movement, the approach employs a self-calibration method to obtain highly accurate relative poses of the adjacent cameras with minor overlap. These enable the use of robust stereo methods to obtain high-quality depth prior in the overlap region. This prior serves not only as an additional input but also as pseudo-labels that enhance the accuracy of depth estimation methods and improve cross-view prediction consistency. The effectiveness of SGDE is evaluated on one fisheye camera dataset, Synthetic Urban, and two pinhole camera datasets, DDAD and nuScenes. Our experiments demonstrate that SGDE is effective for both supervised and self-supervised depth estimation, and highlight the potential of our method for advancing downstream autonomous driving technologies, such as 3D object detection and occupancy prediction. et.al.|[2402.11791](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11791)|null|

Most existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods factorize this problem into perception, motion prediction, and planning. However, we argue that the conventional progressive pipeline still cannot comprehensively model the entire traffic evolution process, e.g., the future interaction between the ego car and other traffic participants and the structural trajectory prior. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving, where the key is to predict how the ego car and the surroundings evolve given past scenes. We propose GenAD, a generative framework that casts autonomous driving into a generative modeling problem. We propose an instance-centric scene tokenizer that first transforms the surrounding scenes into map-aware instance tokens. We then employ a variational autoencoder to learn the future trajectory distribution in a structural latent space for trajectory prior modeling. We further adopt a temporal model to capture the agent and ego movements in the latent space to generate more effective future trajectories. GenAD finally simultaneously performs motion prediction and planning by sampling distributions in the learned structural latent space conditioned on the instance tokens and using the learned temporal model to generate futures. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark show that the proposed GenAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision-centric end-to-end autonomous driving with high efficiency. et.al.|[2402.11502](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11502)|null|

Moreover, recent neuro-symbolic works have shown that incorporating the available background knowledge about the problem at hand in the loss function via t-norms can further improve the deep learning models' performance. However, t-norm-based losses may have very high memory requirements and, thus, they may be impossible to apply in complex application domains like autonomous driving. In this paper, we show how it is possible to define memory-efficient t-norm-based losses, allowing for exploiting t-norms for the task of event detection in autonomous driving. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis on the ROAD-R dataset and show (i) that our proposal can be implemented and run on GPUs with less than 25 GiB of available memory, while standard t-norm-based losses are estimated to require more than 100 GiB, far exceeding the amount of memory normally available, (ii) that t-norm-based losses improve performance, especially when limited labelled data are available, and (iii) that t-norm-based losses can further improve performance when exploited on both labelled and unlabelled data. et.al.|[2402.11362](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11362)|null|

In the multi-model registration problem, we are given two point clouds picturing a set of objects at different poses (and possibly including points belonging to the background) and we want to simultaneously reconstruct how all objects moved between the two point clouds. This setup generalizes standard 3D registration where one wants to reconstruct a single pose, e.g., the motion of the sensor picturing a static scene. Moreover, it provides a mathematically grounded formulation for relevant robotics applications, e.g., where a depth sensor onboard a robot perceives a dynamic scene and has the goal of estimating its own motion (from the static portion of the scene) while simultaneously recovering the motion of all dynamic objects. We assume a correspondence-based setup where we have putative matches between the two point clouds and consider the practical case where these correspondences are plagued with outliers. We then propose a simple approach based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) and establish theoretical conditions under which the EM approach converges to the ground truth. We evaluate the approach in simulated and real datasets ranging from table-top scenes to self-driving scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness when combined with state-of-the-art scene flow methods to establish dense correspondences. et.al.|[2402.10865](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10865)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**RAG-Driver: Generalisable Driving Explanations with Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning in Multi-Modal Large Language Model**|Robots powered by 'blackbox' models need to provide human-understandable explanations which we can trust. Hence, explainability plays a critical role in trustworthy autonomous decision-making to foster transparency and acceptance among end users, especially in complex autonomous driving. Recent advancements in Multi-Modal Large Language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in enhancing the explainability as a driving agent by producing control predictions along with natural language explanations. However, severe data scarcity due to expensive annotation costs and significant domain gaps between different datasets makes the development of a robust and generalisable system an extremely challenging task. Moreover, the prohibitively expensive training requirements of MLLM and the unsolved problem of catastrophic forgetting further limit their generalisability post-deployment. To address these challenges, we present RAG-Driver, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-modal large language model that leverages in-context learning for high-performance, explainable, and generalisable autonomous driving. By grounding in retrieved expert demonstration, we empirically validate that RAG-Driver achieves state-of-the-art performance in producing driving action explanations, justifications, and control signal prediction. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional zero-shot generalisation capabilities to unseen environments without further training endeavours. et.al.|[2402.10828](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10828)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**Efficient Multi-task Uncertainties for Joint Semantic Segmentation and Monocular Depth Estimation**|Quantifying the predictive uncertainty emerged as a possible solution to common challenges like overconfidence or lack of explainability and robustness of deep neural networks, albeit one that is often computationally expensive. Many real-world applications are multi-modal in nature and hence benefit from multi-task learning. In autonomous driving, for example, the joint solution of semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation has proven to be valuable. In this work, we first combine different uncertainty quantification methods with joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation and evaluate how they perform in comparison to each other. Additionally, we reveal the benefits of multi-task learning with regard to the uncertainty quality compared to solving both tasks separately. Based on these insights, we introduce EMUFormer, a novel student-teacher distillation approach for joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation as well as efficient multi-task uncertainty quantification. By implicitly leveraging the predictive uncertainties of the teacher, EMUFormer achieves new state-of-the-art results on Cityscapes and NYUv2 and additionally estimates high-quality predictive uncertainties for both tasks that are comparable or superior to a Deep Ensemble despite being an order of magnitude more efficient. et.al.|[2402.10580](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10580)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**Barrier-Enhanced Homotopic Parallel Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving**|Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced homotopic parallel trajectory optimization (BHPTO) approach with over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BHPTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets. et.al.|[2402.10441](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441)|null|

Our method uses this alpha layer as a clandestine channel invisible to human observers but fully actionable by AI image processors. The scope tested for the vulnerability spans representative vision systems from Apple, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, Nvidia, and Facebook, highlighting the attack's potential breadth. This vulnerability challenges the security protocols of existing and fielded vision systems, from medical imaging to autonomous driving technologies. Our experiments demonstrate that the affected systems, which rely on convolutional neural networks or the latest multimodal language models, cannot quickly mitigate these vulnerabilities through simple patches or updates. Instead, they require retraining and architectural changes, indicating a persistent hole in multimodal technologies without some future adversarial hardening against such vision-language exploits. et.al.|[2402.09671](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09671)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**How Secure Are Large Language Models (LLMs) for Navigation in Urban Environments?**|In the field of robotics and automation, navigation systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive performance. However, the security aspects of these systems have received relatively less attention. This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the technology's widespread application in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS) Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by appending gradient-derived suffixes to the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLMs-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning. Our results, derived from the Touchdown and Map2Seq street-view datasets under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning configurations, demonstrate notable performance declines across three metrics in the face of both white-box and black-box attacks. These results highlight the generalizability and transferability of the NPS Attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced security in LLM-based navigation systems. As an initial countermeasure, we propose the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) Defense strategy, concentrating on navigation-relevant keywords to reduce the impact of adversarial suffixes. While initial findings indicate that this strategy enhances navigational safety, there remains a critical need for the wider research community to develop stronger defense methods to effectively tackle the real-world challenges faced by these systems. et.al.|[2402.09546](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09546)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**PC-NeRF: Parent-Child Neural Radiance Fields Using Sparse LiDAR Frames in Autonomous Driving Environments**|Large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis are vital for autonomous vehicles, especially utilizing temporally sparse LiDAR frames. However, conventional explicit representations remain a significant bottleneck towards representing the reconstructed and synthetic scenes at unlimited resolution. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown compelling results in implicit representations, the problem of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis using sparse LiDAR frames remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis framework called parent-child neural radiance field (PC-NeRF). Based on its two modules, parent NeRF and child NeRF, the framework implements hierarchical spatial partitioning and multi-level scene representation, including scene, segment, and point levels. The multi-level scene representation enhances the efficient utilization of sparse LiDAR point cloud data and enables the rapid acquisition of an approximate volumetric scene representation. With extensive experiments, PC-NeRF is proven to achieve high-precision novel LiDAR view synthesis and 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Moreover, PC-NeRF can effectively handle situations with sparse LiDAR frames and demonstrate high deployment efficiency with limited training epochs.

|**2024-02-14**|**Learning Interpretable Policies in Hindsight-Observable POMDPs through Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning**|Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated remarkable achievements across diverse domains such as video games, robotic control, autonomous driving, and drug discovery. Common methodologies in partially-observable domains largely lean on end-to-end learning from high-dimensional observations, such as images, without explicitly reasoning about true state. We suggest an alternative direction, introducing the Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework. At the heart of PSRL is the fusion of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The approach leverages a state estimator to distill supervised semantic state information from high-dimensional observations which are often fully observable at training time. This yields more interpretable policies that compose state predictions with control. In parallel, it captures an unsupervised latent representation. These two-the semantic state and the latent state-are then fused and utilized as inputs to a policy network. This juxtaposition offers practitioners a flexible and dynamic spectrum: from emphasizing supervised state information to integrating richer, latent insights. Extensive experimental results indicate that by merging these dual representations, PSRL offers a potent balance, enhancing model interpretability while preserving, and often significantly outperforming, the performance benchmarks set by traditional methods in terms of reward and convergence speed. et.al.|[2402.09290](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09290)|null|

The past 30 years have seen rapid development in the autonomous driving space, enabling new technologies that will alleviate the strain placed on human drivers and reduce vehicle emissions. This paper introduces a testbed for evaluating and benchmarking platooning algorithms on 1/10th scale vehicles with onboard sensors. To demonstrate the testbed's utility, we evaluate three algorithms, linear feedback and two variations of distributed model predictive control, and compare their results on a typical platooning scenario where the lead vehicle tracks a reference trajectory that changes speed multiple times. We validate our algorithms in simulation to analyze the performance as the platoon size increases, and find that the distributed model predictive control algorithms outperform linear feedback on hardware and in simulation. et.al.|[2402.09233](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09233)|null|

The primary objective of this digital twin is to perform traffic sign recognition and lane keeping. The digital twin architecture relies on co-simulation and uses the Functional Mock-up Interface and SystemC Transaction Level Modeling standards. The digital twin consists of four clients, i) a vehicle model that is designed in Amesim tool, ii) an environment model developed in Prescan, iii) a lane-keeping controller designed in Robot Operating System, and iv) a perception and speed control module developed in the formal modeling language of BIP (Behavior, Interaction, Priority). These clients interface with the digital twin platform, PAVE360-Veloce System Interconnect (PAVE360-VSI). PAVE360-VSI acts as the co-simulation orchestrator and is responsible for synchronization, interconnection, and data exchange through a server. The server establishes connections among the different clients and also ensures adherence to the Ethernet protocol. We conclude with illustrative digital twin simulations and recommendations for future work. et.al.|[2402.09097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09097)|null|

It encompasses the development of a custom driving environment using Pygame on a track surrounding the University of Memphis map, as well as the design and implementation of the DQN model. The algorithm utilizes data from 7 sensors installed in the car, which measure the distance between the car and the track. These sensors are positioned in front of the vehicle, spaced 20 degrees apart, enabling them to sense a wide area ahead. We successfully implemented the DQN and also a modified version of the DQN with a priority-based action selection mechanism, which we refer to as modified DQN. The model was trained over 1000 episodes, and the average reward received by the agent was found to be around 40, which is approximately 60% higher than the original DQN and around 50% higher than the vanilla neural network. et.al.|[2402.08780](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08780)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**Vehicle Behavior Prediction by Episodic-Memory Implanted NDT**|In autonomous driving, predicting the behavior (turning left, stopping, etc.) of target vehicles is crucial for the self-driving vehicle to make safe decisions and avoid accidents. Existing deep learning-based methods have shown excellent and accurate performance, but the black-box nature makes it untrustworthy to apply them in practical use. In this work, we explore the interpretability of behavior prediction of target vehicles by an Episodic Memory implanted Neural Decision Tree (abbrev. eMem-NDT). The structure of eMem-NDT is constructed by hierarchically clustering the text embedding of vehicle behavior descriptions. eMem-NDT is a neural-backed part of a pre-trained deep learning model by changing the soft-max layer of the deep model to eMem-NDT, for grouping and aligning the memory prototypes of the historical vehicle behavior features in training data on a neural decision tree. Each leaf node of eMem-NDT is modeled by a neural network for aligning the behavior memory prototypes. By eMem-NDT, we infer each instance in behavior prediction of vehicles by bottom-up Memory Prototype Matching (MPM) (searching the appropriate leaf node and the links to the root node) and top-down Leaf Link Aggregation (LLA) (obtaining the probability of future behaviors of vehicles for certain instances). We validate eMem-NDT on BLVD and LOKI datasets, and the results show that our model can obtain a superior performance to other methods with clear explainability.

|**2024-02-13**|**MetaTra: Meta-Learning for Generalized Trajectory Prediction in Unseen Domain**|Trajectory prediction has garnered widespread attention in different fields, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, due to the significant variations in trajectory patterns across different scenarios, models trained in known environments often falter in unseen ones. To learn a generalized model that can directly handle unseen domains without requiring any model updating, we propose a novel meta-learning-based trajectory prediction method called MetaTra. This approach incorporates a Dual Trajectory Transformer (Dual-TT), which enables a thorough exploration of the individual intention and the interactions within group motion patterns in diverse scenarios. Building on this, we propose a meta-learning framework to simulate the generalization process between source and target domains. Furthermore, to enhance the stability of our prediction outcomes, we propose a Serial and Parallel Training (SPT) strategy along with a feature augmentation method named MetaMix. Experimental results on several real-world datasets confirm that MetaTra not only surpasses other state-of-the-art methods but also exhibits plug-and-play capabilities, particularly in the realm of domain generalization. et.al.|[2402.08221](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08221)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**Inherent Diverse Redundant Safety Mechanisms for AI-based Software Elements in Automotive Applications**|This paper explores the role and challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically AI-based software elements, in autonomous driving systems. These AI systems are fundamental in executing real-time critical functions in complex and high-dimensional environments. They handle vital tasks like multi-modal perception, cognition, and decision-making tasks such as motion planning, lane keeping, and emergency braking. A primary concern relates to the ability (and necessity) of AI models to generalize beyond their initial training data. This generalization issue becomes evident in real-time scenarios, where models frequently encounter inputs not represented in their training or validation data. In such cases, AI systems must still function effectively despite facing distributional or domain shifts. This paper investigates the risk associated with overconfident AI models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. To mitigate these risks, methods for training AI models that help maintain performance without overconfidence are proposed. This involves implementing certainty reporting architectures and ensuring diverse training data. While various distribution-based methods exist to provide safety mechanisms for AI models, there is a noted lack of systematic assessment of these methods, especially in the context of safety-critical automotive applications. Many methods in the literature do not adapt well to the quick response times required in safety-critical edge applications. This paper reviews these methods, discusses their suitability for safety-critical applications, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The paper also proposes potential improvements to enhance the safety and reliability of AI algorithms in autonomous vehicles in the context of rapid and accurate decision-making processes. et.al.|[2402.08208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08208)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**User Perception of Partially Automated Driving Systems: A Meaningful Human Control Perspective on the Perception among Tesla Users**|The use of partially automated driving systems raises concerns about potential responsibility issues, posing risk to the system safety, acceptance, and adoption of these technologies. The concept of meaningful human control has emerged in response to the responsibility gap problem, requiring the fulfillment of two conditions, tracking and tracing. While this concept has provided important philosophical and design insights on automated driving systems, there is currently little knowledge on how meaningful human control relates to subjective experiences of actual users of these systems. To address this gap, our study aimed to investigate the alignment between the degree of meaningful human control and drivers' perceptions of safety and trust in a real-world partially automated driving system. We utilized previously collected data from interviews with Tesla "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) Beta users, investigating the alignment between the user perception and how well the system was tracking the users' reasons. We found that tracking of users' reasons for driving tasks (such as safe maneuvers) correlated with perceived safety and trust, albeit with notable exceptions. Surprisingly, failure to track lane changing and braking reasons was not necessarily associated with negative perceptions of safety. However, the failure of the system to track expected maneuvers in dangerous situations always resulted in low trust and perceived lack of safety. Overall, our analyses highlight alignment points but also possible discrepancies between perceived safety and trust on the one hand, and meaningful human control on the other hand. Our results can help the developers of automated driving technology to design systems under meaningful human control and are perceived as safe and trustworthy. et.al.|[2402.08080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08080)|null|

In this paper, we propose a framework for interaction-based refined scenario classification and labeling. Based on the summarized basic types of vehicle interactions, we slice scenario data stream into a series of scenario segments via spatiotemporal scenario evolution tree. The scenario segment statistics of many published scenario datasets are further analyzed. We also propose the scenario metric Graph-DTW based on Graph Computation Tree and Dynamic Time Warping to conduct refined scenario comparison and labeling. The extreme interactive scenarios and corner cases can be efficiently filtered and extracted. Moreover, testing examples on trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of scenario labeling and the proposed metric.

Novelty arises from unexpected scenarios that autonomous vehicles struggle to navigate, necessitating higher-level reasoning abilities. Our proposed method employs language-based representations to identify novel scenes, emphasizing the dual purpose of safety takeover responses and active learning. The research presents a clustering experiment using Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained (CLIP) embeddings to organize datasets and detect novelties.

|**2024-02-10**|**Risk assessment and observation of driver with pedestrian using instantaneous heart rate and HRV**|Currently, human drivers outperform self-driving vehicles in many conditions such as collision avoidance. Therefore, understanding human driver behaviour in these conditions will provide insight for future autonomous vehicles. For understanding driver behaviour, risk assessment is applied so far as one of the approaches by using both subjective and objective measurement. Subjective measurement methods such as questionnaires may provide insight into driver risk assessment but there is often significant variability between drivers.Physiological measurements such as heart rate (HR), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) provide more objective measurements of driver risk assessment. HR is often used for measuring driver risk assessment based on observed correlations between HR and risk perception. Previous work has used HR to measure driver risk assessment in self-driving systems, but pedestrian dynamics is not considered for the research. In this study, we observed driver behaviour in certain scenarios which have pedestrian on driving simulator. The scenarios have safe/unsafe situations (i.e., pedestrian crosses road and vehicle may hit pedestrian in one scenario), HR analysis in time/frequency domain is processed for risk assessment. As a result, HR analysis in frequency domain shows certain reasonability for driver risk assessment when driver has pedestrian in its traffic. et.al.|[2402.07041](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07041)|null|

LiDAR provides highly accurate but sparse depth, whereas camera images enable estimation of dense depth but noisy particularly at long ranges. In this paper, we harness the strengths of both sensors and propose a multimodal 3D scene reconstruction using a framework combining neural implicit surfaces and radiance fields. In particular, our method estimates dense and accurate 3D structures and creates an implicit map representation based on signed distance fields, which can be further rendered into RGB images, and depth maps. A mesh can be extracted from the learned signed distance field and culled based on occlusion. Dynamic objects are efficiently filtered on the fly during sampling using 3D object detection models.

|**2024-02-09**|**Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following**|Diffusion models excel at modeling complex and multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies. et.al.|[2402.06559](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06559)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**CurveFormer++: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Temporal Curve Queries and Attention**|In autonomous driving, 3D lane detection using monocular cameras is an important task for various downstream planning and control tasks. Recent CNN and Transformer approaches usually apply a two-stage scheme in the model design. The first stage transforms the image feature from a front image into a bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Subsequently, a sub-network processes the BEV feature map to generate the 3D detection results. However, these approaches heavily rely on a challenging image feature transformation module from a perspective view to a BEV representation. In our work, we present CurveFormer++, a single-stage Transformer-based method that does not require the image feature view transform module and directly infers 3D lane detection results from the perspective image features. Specifically, our approach models the 3D detection task as a curve propagation problem, where each lane is represented by a curve query with a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. By employing a Transformer decoder, the model can iteratively refine the 3D lane detection results. A curve cross-attention module is introduced in the Transformer decoder to calculate similarities between image features and curve queries of lanes. To handle varying lane lengths, we employ context sampling and anchor point restriction techniques to compute more relevant image features for a curve query. Furthermore, we apply a temporal fusion module that incorporates selected informative sparse curve queries and their corresponding anchor point sets to leverage historical lane information. In the experiments, we evaluate our approach for the 3D lane detection task on two publicly available real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our method provides outstanding performance compared with both CNN and Transformer based methods. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of each component in our approach. et.al.|[2402.06423](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06423)|null|

|**2024-02-08**|**Optimizing Delegation in Collaborative Human-AI Hybrid Teams**|When humans and autonomous systems operate together as what we refer to as a hybrid team, we of course wish to ensure the team operates successfully and effectively. We refer to team members as agents. In our proposed framework, we address the case of hybrid teams in which, at any time, only one team member (the control agent) is authorized to act as control for the team. To determine the best selection of a control agent, we propose the addition of an AI manager (via Reinforcement Learning) which learns as an outside observer of the team. The manager learns a model of behavior linking observations of agent performance and the environment/world the team is operating in, and from these observations makes the most desirable selection of a control agent. We restrict the manager task by introducing a set of constraints. The manager constraints indicate acceptable team operation, so a violation occurs if the team enters a condition which is unacceptable and requires manager intervention. To ensure minimal added complexity or potential inefficiency for the team, the manager should attempt to minimize the number of times the team reaches a constraint violation and requires subsequent manager intervention. Therefore our manager is optimizing its selection of authorized agents to boost overall team performance while minimizing the frequency of manager intervention. We demonstrate our manager performance in a simulated driving scenario representing the case of a hybrid team of agents composed of a human driver and autonomous driving system. We perform experiments for our driving scenario with interfering vehicles, indicating the need for collision avoidance and proper speed control. Our results indicate a positive impact of our manager, with some cases resulting in increased team performance up to ~187% that of the best solo agent performance. et.al.|[2402.05605](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05605)|null|

While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3.

|**2024-02-07**|**Compressing Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks with a Dynamic Structured Pruning Method for Autonomous Driving**|Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in complex autonomous driving scenarios. However, DRL models inevitably bring high memory consumption and computation, which hinders their wide deployment in resource-limited autonomous driving devices. Structured Pruning has been recognized as a useful method to compress and accelerate DRL models, but it is still challenging to estimate the contribution of a parameter (i.e., neuron) to DRL models. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic structured pruning approach that gradually removes a DRL model's unimportant neurons during the training stage. Our method consists of two steps, i.e. training DRL models with a group sparse regularizer and removing unimportant neurons with a dynamic pruning threshold. To efficiently train the DRL model with a small number of important neurons, we employ a neuron-importance group sparse regularizer. In contrast to conventional regularizers, this regularizer imposes a penalty on redundant groups of neurons that do not significantly influence the output of the DRL model. Furthermore, we design a novel structured pruning strategy to dynamically determine the pruning threshold and gradually remove unimportant neurons with a binary mask. Therefore, our method can remove not only redundant groups of neurons of the DRL model but also achieve high and robust performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive with existing DRL pruning methods on discrete control environments (i.e., CartPole-v1 and LunarLander-v2) and MuJoCo continuous environments (i.e., Hopper-v3 and Walker2D-v3). Specifically, our method effectively compresses $93\%$ neurons and $96\%$ weights of the DRL model in four challenging DRL environments with slight accuracy degradation. et.al.|[2402.05146](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05146)|null|
|**2024-02-07**|**Tuning the feedback controller gains is a simple way to improve autonomous driving performance**|Typical autonomous driving systems are a combination of machine learning algorithms (often involving neural networks) and classical feedback controllers. Whilst significant progress has been made in recent years on the neural network side of these systems, only limited progress has been made on the feedback controller side. Often, the feedback control gains are simply passed from paper to paper with little re-tuning taking place, even though the changes to the neural networks can alter the vehicle's closed loop dynamics. The aim of this paper is to highlight the limitations of this approach; it is shown that re-tuning the feedback controller can be a simple way to improve autonomous driving performance. To demonstrate this, the PID gains of the longitudinal controller in the TCP autonomous vehicle algorithm are tuned. This causes the driving score in CARLA to increase from 73.21 to 77.38, with the results averaged over 16 driving scenarios. Moreover, it was observed that the performance benefits were most apparent during challenging driving scenarios, such as during rain or night time, as the tuned controller led to a more assertive driving style. These results demonstrate the value of developing both the neural network and feedback control policies of autonomous driving systems simultaneously, as this can be a simple and methodical way to improve autonomous driving system performance and robustness. et.al.|[2402.05064](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05064)|null|

|**2024-02-07**|**BioDrone: A Bionic Drone-based Single Object Tracking Benchmark for Robust Vision**|Single object tracking (SOT) is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robot navigation. The robustness of SOT faces two main challenges: tiny target and fast motion. These challenges are especially manifested in videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), where the target is usually far away from the camera and often with significant motion relative to the camera. To evaluate the robustness of SOT methods, we propose BioDrone -- the first bionic drone-based visual benchmark for SOT. Unlike existing UAV datasets, BioDrone features videos captured from a flapping-wing UAV system with a major camera shake due to its aerodynamics. BioDrone hence highlights the tracking of tiny targets with drastic changes between consecutive frames, providing a new robust vision benchmark for SOT. To date, BioDrone offers the largest UAV-based SOT benchmark with high-quality fine-grained manual annotations and automatically generates frame-level labels, designed for robust vision analyses. Leveraging our proposed BioDrone, we conduct a systematic evaluation of existing SOT methods, comparing the performance of 20 representative models and studying novel means of optimizing a SOTA method (KeepTrack KeepTrack) for robust SOT. Our evaluation leads to new baselines and insights for robust SOT. Moving forward, we hope that BioDrone will not only serve as a high-quality benchmark for robust SOT, but also invite future research into robust computer vision.

Traditional approaches often rely on computational methods such as time-series analysis. Our research diverges significantly by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrates principles of human cognition and observational behavior into trajectory prediction models for AVs. We introduce a novel "adaptive visual sector" mechanism that mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. Additionally, we develop a "dynamic traffic graph" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies among agents. Benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets reveal that our model (GAVA) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4%, and 12.0%, respectively.

|**2024-02-06**|**Controllable Diverse Sampling for Diffusion Based Motion Behavior Forecasting**|In autonomous driving tasks, trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments requires adherence to real-world context conditions and behavior multimodalities. Existing methods predominantly rely on prior assumptions or generative models trained on curated data to learn road agents' stochastic behavior bounded by scene constraints. However, they often face mode averaging issues due to data imbalance and simplistic priors, and could even suffer from mode collapse due to unstable training and single ground truth supervision. These issues lead the existing methods to a loss of predictive diversity and adherence to the scene constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel trajectory generator named Controllable Diffusion Trajectory (CDT), which integrates map information and social interactions into a Transformer-based conditional denoising diffusion model to guide the prediction of future trajectories. To ensure multimodality, we incorporate behavioral tokens to direct the trajectory's modes, such as going straight, turning right or left. Moreover, we incorporate the predicted endpoints as an alternative behavioral token into the CDT model to facilitate the prediction of accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that CDT excels in generating diverse and scene-compliant trajectories in complex urban settings. et.al.|[2402.03981](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03981)|null|

Recent advancements in learning-based systems have highlighted the importance of integrating prediction and planning modules. However, this integration has brought forth three major challenges: inherent trade-offs by sole prediction, consistency between prediction patterns, and social coherence in prediction and planning. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid-prediction integrated planning (HPP) system, which possesses three novelly designed modules. First, we introduce marginal-conditioned occupancy prediction to align joint occupancy with agent-wise perceptions.

Adverse weather conditions, including haze, dust, rain, snow, and darkness, introduce significant challenges to accurate dense depth estimation, thereby posing substantial safety risks in autonomous driving. These challenges are particularly pronounced for traditional depth estimation methods that rely on short electromagnetic wave sensors, such as visible spectrum cameras and near-infrared LiDAR, due to their susceptibility to diffraction noise and occlusion in such environments.

This algorithm is tailored to address the complex challenges in solution space construction and optimization problem formulation within the path planning domain. Our method employs a multi-objective optimization strategy for efficient navigation in static and highly dynamic environments, focusing on optimizing trajectory comfort, safety, and path precision.

|**2024-02-02**|**Combining Belief Function Theory and Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Multi-Modal Uncertainty in Autonomous Driving**|In automated driving, predicting and accommodating the uncertain future motion of other traffic participants is challenging, especially in unstructured environments in which the high-level intention of traffic participants is difficult to predict. Several possible uncertain future behaviors of traffic participants must be considered, resulting in multi-modal uncertainty. We propose a novel combination of Belief Function Theory and Stochastic Model Predictive Control for trajectory planning of the autonomous vehicle in presence of significant uncertainty about the intention estimation of traffic participants. A misjudgment of the intention of traffic participants may result in dangerous situations. At the same time, excessive conservatism must be avoided. Therefore, the measure of reliability of the estimation provided by Belief Function Theory is used in the design of collision-avoidance safety constraints, in particular to increase safety when the intention of traffic participants is not clear. We discuss two methods to leverage on Belief Function Theory: we introduce a novel belief-to-probability transformation designed not to underestimate unlikely events if the information is uncertain, and a constraint tightening mechanism using the reliability of the estimation. We evaluate our proposal through simulations comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. et.al.|[2402.00697](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00697)|null|
|**2024-02-01**|**Fisheye Camera and Ultrasonic Sensor Fusion For Near-Field Obstacle Perception in Bird's-Eye-View**|Accurate obstacle identification represents a fundamental challenge within the scope of near-field perception for autonomous driving. Conventionally, fisheye cameras are frequently employed for comprehensive surround-view perception, including rear-view obstacle localization. However, the performance of such cameras can significantly deteriorate in low-light conditions, during nighttime, or when subjected to intense sun glare. Conversely, cost-effective sensors like ultrasonic sensors remain largely unaffected under these conditions. Therefore, we present, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion model tailored for efficient obstacle perception in a bird's-eye-view (BEV) perspective, utilizing fisheye cameras and ultrasonic sensors. Initially, ResNeXt-50 is employed as a set of unimodal encoders to extract features specific to each modality. Subsequently, the feature space associated with the visible spectrum undergoes transformation into BEV. The fusion of these two modalities is facilitated via concatenation. At the same time, the ultrasonic spectrum-based unimodal feature maps pass through content-aware dilated convolution, applied to mitigate the sensor misalignment between two sensors in the fused feature space. Finally, the fused features are utilized by a two-stage semantic occupancy decoder to generate grid-wise predictions for precise obstacle perception. We conduct a systematic investigation to determine the optimal strategy for multimodal fusion of both sensors. We provide insights into our dataset creation procedures, annotation guidelines, and perform a thorough data analysis to ensure adequate coverage of all scenarios. When applied to our dataset, the experimental results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed multimodal fusion approach. et.al.|[2402.00637](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00637)|null|

Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting. While state-of-the-art methods already feature good predictive performance, they often suffer from miscalibrated uncertainty estimates. However, having well-calibrated uncertainty estimates is important, especially in safety-critical domains like medicine and autonomous driving. In this article, we propose a novel nearest-neighbor-based partial-label-learning algorithm that leverages Dempster-Shafer theory. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that the proposed method provides a well-calibrated uncertainty estimate and achieves competitive prediction performance.

|**2024-02-01**|**Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surfaces for MEC-Assisted Autonomous Driving Networks**|In this paper, we focus on improving autonomous driving safety via task offloading from cellular vehicles (CVs), using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, to an multi-access edge computing (MEC) server. Considering that the frequencies used for V2I links can be reused for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of each V2I link may suffer from severe interference, causing outages in the task offloading process. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) to enable, not only V2I reflective links, but also interference cancellation at the V2V links exploiting the computational capability of its metamaterials. We devise a joint optimization formulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server, the spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as the RICS reflection and refraction matrices, with the objective to maximize a safety-based autonomous driving task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more tractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems and solved via an alternate approximation method. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RICS optimization in improving the safety in autonomous driving networks. et.al.|[2402.00398](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00398)|null|

Simultaneously, recent parallel works in robotics have devised efficient algorithms for multi-agent path finding (MAPF), though often in environments with simplified kinematics. In this work, we hybridize insights and algorithms from MAPF with the structure and heuristics of optimizing the crossing order of CAVs at signal-free intersections. We devise an optimal and complete algorithm, Order-based Search with Kinematics Arrival Time Scheduling (OBS-KATS), which significantly outperforms existing algorithms, fixed heuristics, and prioritized planning with KATS. The performance is maintained under different vehicle arrival rates, lane lengths, crossing speeds, and control horizon. Through ablations and dissections, we offer insight on the contributing factors to OBS-KATS's performance.

However, time-varying channel variations in vehicular transmission environments demand dynamic allocation of communication resources. Moreover, in the context of collaborative perception, it is important to recognize that not all CAVs contribute valuable data, and some CAV data even have detrimental effects on collaborative perception. In this paper, we introduce SmartCooper, an adaptive collaborative perception framework that incorporates communication optimization and a judger mechanism to facilitate CAV data fusion. Our approach begins with optimizing the connectivity of vehicles while considering communication constraints. We then train a learnable encoder to dynamically adjust the compression ratio based on the channel state information (CSI). Subsequently, we devise a judger mechanism to filter the detrimental image data reconstructed by adaptive decoders. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on the OpenCOOD platform. Our results demonstrate a substantial reduction in communication costs by 23.10\% compared to the non-judger scheme. Additionally, we achieve a significant improvement on the average precision of Intersection over Union (AP@IoU) by 7.15\% compared with state-of-the-art schemes. et.al.|[2402.00321](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00321)|null|
|**2024-01-31**|**Real-time Traffic Object Detection for Autonomous Driving**|With recent advances in computer vision, it appears that autonomous driving will be part of modern society sooner rather than later. However, there are still a significant number of concerns to address. Although modern computer vision techniques demonstrate superior performance, they tend to prioritize accuracy over efficiency, which is a crucial aspect of real-time applications. Large object detection models typically require higher computational power, which is achieved by using more sophisticated onboard hardware. For autonomous driving, these requirements translate to increased fuel costs and, ultimately, a reduction in mileage. Further, despite their computational demands, the existing object detectors are far from being real-time. In this research, we assess the robustness of our previously proposed, highly efficient pedestrian detector LSFM on well-established autonomous driving benchmarks, including diverse weather conditions and nighttime scenes. Moreover, we extend our LSFM model for general object detection to achieve real-time object detection in traffic scenes. We evaluate its performance, low latency, and generalizability on traffic object detection datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the inadequacy of the current key performance indicator employed by object detection systems in the context of autonomous driving and propose a more suitable alternative that incorporates real-time requirements. et.al.|[2402.00128](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00128)|null|

Our method maps an image to a distribution over plausible 3D latent scene configurations using a probabilistic encoder, and predicts the evolution of the hypothesized scenes through time. Our latent scene representation conditions a global Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to represent a 3D scene model, which enables explainable predictions and straightforward downstream applications. This approach extends beyond previous neural rendering work by considering complex scenarios of uncertainty in environmental states and dynamics. We employ a two-stage training of Pose-Conditional-VAE and NeRF to learn 3D representations. Additionally, we auto-regressively predict latent scene representations as a partially observable Markov decision process, utilizing a mixture density network.

|**2024-01-31**|**LaneGraph2Seq: Lane Topology Extraction with Language Model via Vertex-Edge Encoding and Connectivity Enhancement**|Understanding road structures is crucial for autonomous driving. Intricate road structures are often depicted using lane graphs, which include centerline curves and connections forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Accurate extraction of lane graphs relies on precisely estimating vertex and edge information within the DAG. Recent research highlights Transformer-based language models' impressive sequence prediction abilities, making them effective for learning graph representations when graph data are encoded as sequences. However, existing studies focus mainly on modeling vertices explicitly, leaving edge information simply embedded in the network. Consequently, these approaches fall short in the task of lane graph extraction. To address this, we introduce LaneGraph2Seq, a novel approach for lane graph extraction. It leverages a language model with vertex-edge encoding and connectivity enhancement. Our serialization strategy includes a vertex-centric depth-first traversal and a concise edge-based partition sequence. Additionally, we use classifier-free guidance combined with nucleus sampling to improve lane connectivity. We validate our method on prominent datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse 2, showcasing consistent and compelling results.

|**2024-01-30**|**MF-MOS: A Motion-Focused Model for Moving Object Segmentation**|Moving object segmentation (MOS) provides a reliable solution for detecting traffic participants and thus is of great interest in the autonomous driving field. Dynamic capture is always critical in the MOS problem. Previous methods capture motion features from the range images directly. Differently, we argue that the residual maps provide greater potential for motion information, while range images contain rich semantic guidance. Based on this intuition, we propose MF-MOS, a novel motion-focused model with a dual-branch structure for LiDAR moving object segmentation. Novelly, we decouple the spatial-temporal information by capturing the motion from residual maps and generating semantic features from range images, which are used as movable object guidance for the motion branch. Our straightforward yet distinctive solution can make the most use of both range images and residual maps, thus greatly improving the performance of the LiDAR-based MOS task. Remarkably, our MF-MOS achieved a leading IoU of 76.7% on the MOS leaderboard of the SemanticKITTI dataset upon submission, demonstrating the current state-of-the-art performance.

Due to a lack of verification methods for high-dimensional DNNs, a trade-off is needed between accepted performance and handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.   This work evaluates rejecting outputs from semantic segmentation DNNs by applying a Mahalanobis distance (MD) based on the most probable class-conditional Gaussian distribution for the predicted class as an OOD score. The evaluation follows three DNNs trained on the Cityscapes dataset and tested on four automotive datasets and finds that classification risk can drastically be reduced at the cost of pixel coverage, even when applied on unseen datasets. The applicability of our findings will support legitimizing safety measures and motivate their usage when arguing for safe usage of DNNs in automotive perception. et.al.|[2401.17013](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17013)|null|

|**2024-01-30**|**I came, I saw, I certified: some perspectives on the safety assurance of cyber-physical systems**|The execution failure of cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous driving systems, unmanned aerial systems, and robotic systems) could result in the loss of life, severe injuries, large-scale environmental damage, property destruction, and major economic loss. Hence, such systems usually require a strong justification that they will effectively support critical requirements (e.g., safety, security, and reliability) for which they were designed. Thus, it is often mandatory to develop compelling assurance cases to support that justification and allow regulatory bodies to certify such systems. In such contexts, detecting assurance deficits, relying on patterns to improve the structure of assurance cases, improving existing assurance case notations, and (semi-)automating the generation of assurance cases are key to develop compelling assurance cases and foster consumer acceptance. We therefore explore challenges related to such assurance enablers and outline some potential directions that could be explored to tackle them. et.al.|[2401.16633](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16633)|null|

Existing studies have attempted to capture interactions between road entities by using the definite data in history timesteps, as future information is not available and involves high uncertainty. However, without sufficient guidance for capturing future states of interacting agents, they frequently produce unrealistic trajectory overlaps. In this work, we propose Future Interaction modeling for Motion Prediction (FIMP), which captures potential future interactions in an end-to-end manner. FIMP adopts a future decoder that implicitly extracts the potential future information in an intermediate feature-level, and identifies the interacting entity pairs through future affinity learning and top-k filtering strategy.

Many networks with large-scale point clouds as input use voxelization to create a pseudo-image for real-time running. However, the voxelization process often results in the loss of point-specific features. This gives rise to a challenge in recovering those features for scene flow tasks. Our paper introduces DeFlow which enables a transition from voxel-based features to point features using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) refinement. To further enhance scene flow estimation performance, we formulate a novel loss function that accounts for the data imbalance between static and dynamic points.

Due to its potentially rich semantic information, RGB image is commonly fused to enhance the completion effect. Image-guided depth completion involves three key challenges: 1) how to effectively fuse the two modalities; 2) how to better recover depth information; and 3) how to achieve real-time prediction for practical autonomous driving. To solve the above problems, we propose a concise but effective network, named CENet, to achieve high-performance depth completion with a simple and elegant structure. Firstly, we use a fast guidance module to fuse the two sensor features, utilizing abundant auxiliary features extracted from the color space. Unlike other commonly used complicated guidance modules, our approach is intuitive and low-cost. In addition, we find and analyze the optimization inconsistency problem for observed and unobserved positions, and a decoupled depth prediction head is proposed to alleviate the issue. The proposed decoupled head can better output the depth of valid and invalid positions with very few extra inference time. Based on the simple structure of dual-encoder and single-decoder, our CENet can achieve superior balance between accuracy and efficiency. In the KITTI depth completion benchmark, our CENet attains competitive performance and inference speed compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Meanwhile, accurate 3D object detection from pure images is very challenging due to the loss of depth information. Most existing image-based methods infer objects' location in 3D space based on their 2D sizes on the image plane, which usually ignores the intrinsic position clues from images, leading to unsatisfactory performances. Motivated by the fact that humans could leverage the bottom-up positional clues to locate objects in 3D space from a single image, in this paper, we explore the position modeling from the image feature column and propose a new method named You Only Look Bottum-Up (YOLOBU). Specifically, our YOLOBU leverages Column-based Cross Attention to determine how much a pixel contributes to pixels above it. Next, the Row-based Reverse Cumulative Sum (RRCS) is introduced to build the connections of pixels in the bottom-up direction.

To achieve this, we propose an online learning-based behavior prediction model and an efficient planner for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We develop a learning-based prediction model, enhanced with a recurrent neural memory network, to dynamically update latent belief states and infer the intentions of other agents. The model can also integrate the ego vehicle's intentions to reflect closed-loop interactions among agents, and it learns from both offline data and online interactions. For planning, we employ an option-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner, which reduces computational complexity by searching over action sequences. Inside the MCTS planner, we use predicted long-term multi-modal trajectories to approximate future updates, which eliminates iterative belief updating and improves the running efficiency. Our approach also incorporates deep Q-learning (DQN) as a search prior, which significantly improves the performance of the MCTS planner. Experimental results from simulated environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The online belief update model can significantly enhance the accuracy and temporal consistency of predictions, leading to improved decision-making performance. Employing DQN as a search prior in the MCTS planner considerably boosts its performance and outperforms an imitation learning-based prior. Additionally, we show that the option-based MCTS substantially outperforms the vanilla method in terms of performance and efficiency. et.al.|[2401.15315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15315)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**DAM: Diffusion Activation Maximization for 3D Global Explanations**|In recent years, the performance of point cloud models has been rapidly improved. However, due to the limited amount of relevant explainability studies, the unreliability and opacity of these black-box models may lead to potential risks in applications where human lives are at stake, e.g. autonomous driving or healthcare. This work proposes a DDPM-based point cloud global explainability method (DAM) that leverages Point Diffusion Transformer (PDT), a novel point-wise symmetric model, with dual-classifier guidance to generate high-quality global explanations. In addition, an adapted path gradient integration method for DAM is proposed, which not only provides a global overview of the saliency maps for point cloud categories, but also sheds light on how the attributions of the explanations vary during the generation process. Extensive experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing ones in terms of perceptibility, representativeness, and diversity, with a significant reduction in generation time.

|**2024-01-26**|**How does Simulation-based Testing for Self-driving Cars match Human Perception?**|Software metrics such as coverage and mutation scores have been extensively explored for the automated quality assessment of test suites. While traditional tools rely on such quantifiable software metrics, the field of self-driving cars (SDCs) has primarily focused on simulation-based test case generation using quality metrics such as the out-of-bound (OOB) parameter to determine if a test case fails or passes. However, it remains unclear to what extent this quality metric aligns with the human perception of the safety and realism of SDCs, which are critical aspects in assessing SDC behavior. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study involving 50 participants to investigate the factors that determine how humans perceive SDC test cases as safe, unsafe, realistic, or unrealistic. To this aim, we developed a framework leveraging virtual reality (VR) technologies, called SDC-Alabaster, to immerse the study participants into the virtual environment of SDC simulators. Our findings indicate that the human assessment of the safety and realism of failing and passing test cases can vary based on different factors, such as the test's complexity and the possibility of interacting with the SDC. Especially for the assessment of realism, the participants' age as a confounding factor leads to a different perception. This study highlights the need for more research on SDC simulation testing quality metrics and the importance of human perception in evaluating SDC behavior. et.al.|[2401.14736](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14736)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**Diversity-guided Search Exploration for Self-driving Cars Test Generation through Frenet Space Encoding**|The rise of self-driving cars (SDCs) presents important safety challenges to address in dynamic environments. While field testing is essential, current methods lack diversity in assessing critical SDC scenarios. Prior research introduced simulation-based testing for SDCs, with Frenetic, a test generation approach based on Frenet space encoding, achieving a relatively high percentage of valid tests (approximately 50%) characterized by naturally smooth curves. The "minimal out-of-bound distance" is often taken as a fitness function, which we argue to be a sub-optimal metric. Instead, we show that the likelihood of leading to an out-of-bound condition can be learned by the deep-learning vanilla transformer model. We combine this "inherently learned metric" with a genetic algorithm, which has been shown to produce a high diversity of tests. To validate our approach, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation on a dataset comprising over 1,174 simulated test cases created to challenge the SDCs behavior. Our investigation revealed that our approach demonstrates a substantial reduction in generating non-valid test cases, increased diversity, and high accuracy in identifying safety violations during SDC test execution. et.al.|[2401.14682](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14682)|null|

|**2024-01-25**|**Unlocking Past Information: Temporal Embeddings in Cooperative Bird's Eye View Prediction**|Accurate and comprehensive semantic segmentation of Bird's Eye View (BEV) is essential for ensuring safe and proactive navigation in autonomous driving. Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%. The code will be published on GitHub. et.al.|[2401.14325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14325)|null|
|**2024-01-25**|**MultiTest: Physical-Aware Object Insertion for Testing Multi-sensor Fusion Perception Systems**|Multi-sensor fusion stands as a pivotal technique in addressing numerous safety-critical tasks and applications, e.g., self-driving cars and automated robotic arms. With the continuous advancement in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), MSF's potential for sensing and understanding intricate external environments has been further amplified, bringing a profound impact on intelligent systems and specifically on their perception systems. Similar to traditional software, adequate testing is also required for AI-enabled MSF systems. Yet, existing testing methods primarily concentrate on single-sensor perception systems (e.g., image-/point cloud-based object detection systems). There remains a lack of emphasis on generating multi-modal test cases for MSF systems. To address these limitations, we design and implement MultiTest, a fitness-guided metamorphic testing method for complex MSF perception systems. MultiTest employs a physical-aware approach to synthesize realistic multi-modal object instances and insert them into critical positions of background images and point clouds. A fitness metric is designed to guide and boost the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments with five SOTA perception systems to evaluate MultiTest from the perspectives of: (1) generated test cases' realism, (2) fault detection capabilities, and (3) performance improvement. The results show that MultiTest can generate realistic and modality-consistent test data and effectively detect hundreds of diverse faults of an MSF system under test. Moreover, retraining an MSF system on the test cases generated by MultiTest can improve the system's robustness. et.al.|[2401.14314](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14314)|null|

Naturally, this data not only serves self-driving algorithms; but can also assist other vehicles or the infrastructure in real-time decision-making. Consequently, vehicles shall exchange their measurement data over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover, predicting the state of the road network might be beneficial too. With such a prediction, we might mitigate road congestion, balance parking lot usage, or optimize the traffic flow. That would decrease transportation costs as well as reduce its environmental impact.   In this paper, we propose a federated measurement and learning system that provides real-time data to fellow vehicles over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication while also operating a federated learning (FL) scheme over the Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) link to create a predictive model of the transportation network. As we are yet to have real-world AV data, we model it with a non-IID (independent and identically distributed) dataset to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed system in terms of performance and privacy. Results indicate that the proposed FL scheme improves learning performance and prevents eavesdropping at the aggregator server side. et.al.|[2401.13848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13848)|**[link](https://github.com/alelevente/felesh)**|

The evolution of 3D semantic occupancy prediction as a pretraining task for autonomous driving and robotic downstream tasks captures finer 3D details compared to methods like 3D detection. Existing approaches predominantly focus on spatial cues, often overlooking temporal cues. Query-based methods tend to converge on computationally intensive Voxel representation for encoding 3D scene information. This study introduces S2TPVFormer, an extension of TPVFormer, utilizing a spatiotemporal transformer architecture for coherent 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Emphasizing the importance of spatiotemporal cues in 3D scene perception, particularly in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, our work explores the less-explored realm of temporal cues. Leveraging Tri-Perspective View (TPV) representation, our spatiotemporal encoder generates temporally rich embeddings, improving prediction coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. To achieve this, we propose a novel Temporal Cross-View Hybrid Attention (TCVHA) mechanism, facilitating effective spatiotemporal information exchange across TPV views. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate a substantial 3.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 3D Semantic Occupancy compared to TPVFormer, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed S2TPVFormer in enhancing 3D scene perception. et.al.|[2401.13785](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13785)|null|

|**2024-01-24**|**ADMap: Anti-disturbance framework for reconstructing online vectorized HD map**|In the field of autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) map reconstruction is crucial for planning tasks. Recent research has developed several high-performance HD map reconstruction models to meet this necessity. However, the point sequences within the instance vectors may be jittery or jagged due to prediction bias, which can impact subsequent tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes the Anti-disturbance Map reconstruction framework (ADMap). To mitigate point-order jitter, the framework consists of three modules: Multi-Scale Perception Neck, Instance Interactive Attention (IIA), and Vector Direction Difference Loss (VDDL). By exploring the point-order relationships between and within instances in a cascading manner, the model can monitor the point-order prediction process more effectively. ADMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

|**2024-01-23**|**Self-supervised Learning of LiDAR 3D Point Clouds via 2D-3D Neural Calibration**|This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for enhancing 3D perception in autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, our approach, named NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid transformation aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid transformation. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate NCLR's efficacy by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

|**2024-01-22**|**Enhancing Safety in Nonlinear Systems: Design and Stability Analysis of Adaptive Cruise Control**|The safety of autonomous driving systems, particularly self-driving vehicles, remains of paramount concern. These systems exhibit affine nonlinear dynamics and face the challenge of executing predefined control tasks while adhering to state and input constraints to mitigate risks. However, achieving safety control within the framework of control input constraints, such as collision avoidance and maintaining system states within secure boundaries, presents challenges due to limited options. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to address safety concerns by transforming safety conditions into control constraints with a relative degree of 1. This transformation is facilitated through the design of control barrier functions, enabling the creation of a safety control system for affine nonlinear networks. Subsequently, we formulate a robust control strategy that incorporates safety protocols and conduct a comprehensive analysis of its stability and reliability. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a specific problem involving adaptive cruise control. Through simulations, we validate the efficiency of our model in ensuring safety without compromising control performance. Our approach signifies significant progress in the field, providing a practical solution to enhance safety for autonomous driving systems operating within the context of affine nonlinear dynamics. et.al.|[2401.11961](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11961)|null|

LiDAR point clouds, offering accurate depth information, serve as a crucial information for this purpose. Our study focuses on key challenges in 3D target detection. To tackle the challenge of expanding the receptive field of a 3D convolutional kernel, we introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM). This module achieves adaptive expansion of the 3D convolutional kernel's receptive field, balancing the expansion with acceptable computational loads. This innovation reduces operations, expands the receptive field, and allows the model to dynamically adjust to different object requirements. Simultaneously, we identify redundant information in 3D features. Employing the Feature Selection Module (FSM) quantitatively evaluates and eliminates non-important features, achieving the separation of output box fitting and feature extraction. This innovation enables the detector to focus on critical features, resulting in model compression, reduced computational burden, and minimized candidate frame interference. Extensive experiments confirm that both DFFM and FSM not only enhance current benchmarks, particularly in small target detection, but also accelerate network performance.

However, as different configurations of a test scenario will affect the sensor perceptions and environment interaction, e.g. light pulses emitted by the LiDAR sensor will undergo backscattering and attenuation, which is usually overlooked by existing works, leading to false positives or wrong results. Moreover, the input space of an ADS is extremely large, with infinite number of possible initial scenarios and mutations, along both temporal and spatial domains.   This paper proposes a first-principles based sensor modeling and environment interaction scheme, and integrates it into CARLA simulator. With this scheme, a long-overlooked category of adverse weather related corner cases are discovered, along with their root causes. Moreover, a meta-heuristic algorithm is designed based on several empirical insights, which guide both seed scenarios and mutations, significantly reducing the search dimensions of scenarios and enhancing the efficiency of corner case identification. Experimental results show that under identical simulation setups, our algorithm discovers about four times as many corner cases as compared to state-of-the-art work. et.al.|[2401.11876](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11876)|null|

However, existing methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning suffer from low safety, poor generalization, and inefficient sampling. Additionally, they cannot accurately predict future driving trajectories, and the accurate prediction of future driving trajectories is a precondition for making optimal decisions. To solve these problems, in this paper, we introduce a Safe and Generalized end-to-end Autonomous Driving System (SGADS) for complex and various scenarios. Our SGADS incorporates variational inference with normalizing flows, enabling the intelligent vehicle to accurately predict future driving trajectories. Moreover, we propose the formulation of robust safety constraints. Furthermore, we combine reinforcement learning with demonstrations to augment search process of the agent.

Nevertheless, conventional approaches often address these two problems independently, employing separate models for each task. This approach poses practical limitations in real-world scenarios, particularly when computational resources are scarce or real-time performance is imperative. Hence, in this article, we introduce S$^3$M-Net, a novel joint learning framework developed to perform semantic segmentation and stereo matching simultaneously. Specifically, S$^3$ M-Net shares the features extracted from RGB images between both tasks, resulting in an improved overall scene understanding capability. This feature sharing process is realized using a feature fusion adaption (FFA) module, which effectively transforms the shared features into semantic space and subsequently fuses them with the encoded disparity features. The entire joint learning framework is trained by minimizing a novel semantic consistency-guided (SCG) loss, which places emphasis on the structural consistency in both tasks.

|**2024-01-20**|**Enhancing System-Level Safety in Mixed-Autonomy Platoon via Safe Reinforcement Learning**|Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have recently gained prominence in traffic research, thanks to the advancements in communication technology and autonomous driving. A variety of longitudinal control strategies for CAVs have been developed to enhance traffic efficiency, stability, and safety in mixed-autonomy scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising strategy for mixed-autonomy platoon control since it can tackle complex scenarios in real-time. However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, incorporating safety considerations into DRL typically relies on designing collision avoidance-based reward functions, which lack collision-free guarantees. Second, current DRL-based-control approaches for mixed traffic only consider the safety of CAVs, with little attention paid to the surrounding HDVs. To address the research gaps, we introduce a differentiable safety layer that converts DRL actions into safe actions with collision-free guarantees. This process relies on solving a differentiable quadratic programming problem that incorporates control barrier function-based (CBF) safety constraints for both CAV and its following HDVs to achieve system-level safety. Moreover, constructing CBF constraints needs system dynamics for the following HDVs, and thus we employ an online system identification module to estimate the car-following dynamics of the surrounding HDVs. The proposed safe reinforcement learning approach explicitly integrates system-level safety constraints into the training process and enables our method to adapt to varying safety-critical scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively ensures CAV safety and improves HDV safety in mixed platoon environments while simultaneously enhancing traffic capacity and string stability. et.al.|[2401.11148](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11148)|null|

However, the rising connectivity coupled with the legacy network architecture within vehicles can be exploited for launching active and passive attacks on critical vehicle systems and directly affecting the safety of passengers. Machine learning-based intrusion detection models have been shown to successfully detect multiple targeted attack vectors in recent literature, whose deployments are enabled through quantised neural networks targeting low-power platforms. Multiple models are often required to simultaneously detect multiple attack vectors, increasing the area, (resource) cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a case for utilising custom-quantised MLP's (CQMLP) as a multi-class classification model, capable of detecting multiple attacks from the benign flow of controller area network (CAN) messages. The specific quantisation and neural architecture are determined through a joint design space exploration, resulting in our choice of the 2-bit precision and the n-layer MLP. Our 2-bit version is trained using Brevitas and optimised as a dataflow hardware model through the FINN toolflow from AMD/Xilinx, targeting an XCZU7EV device. We show that the 2-bit CQMLP model, when integrated as the IDS, can detect malicious attack messages (DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attack) with a very high accuracy of 99.9%, on par with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Furthermore, the dataflow model can perform line rate detection at a latency of 0.11 ms from message reception while consuming 0.23 mJ/inference, making it ideally suited for integration with an ECU in critical CAN networks. et.al.|[2401.11030](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11030)|null|

This increased access to in-vehicle functions compromises critical capabilities that use legacy invehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN), which has no inherent security or authentication mechanism. Intrusion detection and mitigation approaches, particularly using machine learning models, have shown promising results in detecting multiple attack vectors in CAN through their ability to generalise to new vectors. However, most deployments require dedicated computing units like GPUs to perform line-rate detection, consuming much higher power. In this paper, we present a lightweight multi-attack quantised machine learning model that is deployed using Xilinx's Deep Learning Processing Unit IP on a Zynq Ultrascale+ (XCZU3EG) FPGA, which is trained and validated using the public CAN Intrusion Detection dataset. The quantised model detects denial of service and fuzzing attacks with an accuracy of above 99 % and a false positive rate of 0.07%, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) execution consumes just 2.0 W with software tasks running on the ECU and achieves a 25 % reduction in per-message processing latency over the state-of-the-art implementations. This deployment allows the ECU function to coexist with the IDS with minimal changes to the tasks, making it ideal for real-time IDS in in-vehicle systems. et.al.|[2401.10689](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10689)|null|

Various intrusion detection approaches have been proposed to detect and tackle such threats, with machine learning models proving highly effective. However, deploying machine learning models will require high processing power through high-end processors or GPUs to perform them close to line rate.

Our results show that the proposed approach provides an average accuracy of over 99% across multiple attack datasets with 0.64% false detection rates while consuming 94% less energy and achieving 51.8% reduction in per-message processing latency when compared to IDS implementations on GPUs. et.al.|[2401.10674](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10674)|null|
|**2024-01-19**|**BadODD: Bangladeshi Autonomous Driving Object Detection Dataset**|We propose a comprehensive dataset for object detection in diverse driving environments across 9 districts in Bangladesh. The dataset, collected exclusively from smartphone cameras, provided a realistic representation of real-world scenarios, including day and night conditions. Most existing datasets lack suitable classes for autonomous navigation on Bangladeshi roads, making it challenging for researchers to develop models that can handle the intricacies of road scenarios. To address this issue, the authors proposed a new set of classes based on characteristics rather than local vehicle names. The dataset aims to encourage the development of models that can handle the unique challenges of Bangladeshi road scenarios for the effective deployment of autonomous vehicles. The dataset did not consist of any online images to simulate real-world conditions faced by autonomous vehicles. The classification of vehicles is challenging because of the diverse range of vehicles on Bangladeshi roads, including those not found elsewhere in the world. The proposed classification system is scalable and can accommodate future vehicles, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the autonomous vehicle sector. et.al.|[2401.10659](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10659)|null|
|**2024-01-19**|**Episodic Reinforcement Learning with Expanded State-reward Space**|Empowered by deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated tremendous empirical successes in various domains, including games, health care, and autonomous driving. Despite these advancements, DRL is still identified as data-inefficient as effective policies demand vast numbers of environmental samples. Recently, episodic control (EC)-based model-free DRL methods enable sample efficiency by recalling past experiences from episodic memory. However, existing EC-based methods suffer from the limitation of potential misalignment between the state and reward spaces for neglecting the utilization of (past) retrieval states with extensive information, which probably causes inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce an efficient EC-based DRL framework with expanded state-reward space, where the expanded states used as the input and the expanded rewards used in the training both contain historical and current information. To be specific, we reuse the historical states retrieved by EC as part of the input states and integrate the retrieved MC-returns into the immediate reward in each interactive transition. As a result, our method is able to simultaneously achieve the full utilization of retrieval information and the better evaluation of state values by a Temporal Difference (TD) loss. Empirical results on challenging Box2d and Mujoco tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over a recent sibling method and common baselines. Further, we also verify our method's effectiveness in alleviating Q-value overestimation by additional experiments of Q-value comparison. et.al.|[2401.10516](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10516)|null|
|**2024-01-19**|**Towards Automated Driving Violation Cause Analysis in Scenario-Based Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems**|The rapid advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), exemplified by companies like Waymo and Cruise offering 24/7 paid taxi services, highlights the paramount importance of ensuring AVs' compliance with various policies, such as safety regulations, traffic rules, and mission directives. Despite significant progress in the development of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing tools, there has been a notable absence of research on attributing the causes of driving violations. Counterfactual causality analysis has emerged as a promising approach for identifying the root cause of program failures. While it has demonstrated effectiveness in pinpointing error-inducing inputs, its direct application to the AV context to determine which computation result, generated by which component, serves as the root cause poses a considerable challenge. A key obstacle lies in our inability to straightforwardly eliminate the influence of a specific internal message to establish the causal relationship between the output of each component and a system-level driving violation.   In this work, we propose a novel driving violation cause analysis (DVCA) tool. We design idealized component substitutes to enable counterfactual analysis of ADS components by leveraging the unique opportunity provided by the simulation. We evaluate our tool on a benchmark with real bugs and injected faults. The results show that our tool can achieve perfect component-level attribution accuracy (100%) and almost (>98%) perfect message-level accuracy. Our tool can reduce the debugging scope from hundreds of complicated interdependent messages to one single computation result generated by one component. et.al.|[2401.10443](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10443)|null|

This paper introduces the Siamese Masked Conditional Variational Autoencoder (SiamMCVAE), leveraging a siamese architecture with twin encoders based on vision transformers. This innovative design enhances the model's ability to comprehend lost content by capturing intrinsic similarities between paired frames. SiamMCVAE proficiently reconstructs missing elements in masked frames, effectively addressing issues arising from camera malfunctions through variational inferences. Experimental results robustly demonstrate the model's effectiveness in restoring missing information, thus enhancing the resilience of computer vision systems.

Mainstream research has looked into improving the performance metrics for classification accuracy. However, the hidden traits of bias inheritance in the AI models, class imbalances and disparities in the datasets are often overlooked. In this context, our study examines the class imbalances for vulnerable road users by focusing on class distribution analysis, performance evaluation, and bias impact assessment. We identify the concern of imbalances in class representation, leading to potential biases in detection accuracy. Utilizing popular CNN models and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the nuScenes dataset, our performance evaluation reveals detection disparities for underrepresented classes. We propose a methodology for model optimization and bias mitigation, which includes data augmentation, resampling, and metric-specific learning. Using the proposed mitigation approaches, we see improvement in IoU(%) and NDS(%) metrics from 71.3 to 75.6 and 80.6 to 83.7 respectively, for the CNN model. Similarly, for ViT, we observe improvement in IoU and NDS metrics from 74.9 to 79.2 and 83.8 to 87.1 respectively. This research contributes to developing more reliable models and datasets, enhancing inclusiveness for minority classes. et.al.|[2401.10397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10397)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**LangProp: A code optimization framework using Language Models applied to driving**|LangProp is a framework for iteratively optimizing code generated by large language models (LLMs) in a supervised/reinforcement learning setting. While LLMs can generate sensible solutions zero-shot, the solutions are often sub-optimal. Especially for code generation tasks, it is likely that the initial code will fail on certain edge cases. LangProp automatically evaluates the code performance on a dataset of input-output pairs, as well as catches any exceptions, and feeds the results back to the LLM in the training loop, so that the LLM can iteratively improve the code it generates. By adopting a metric- and data-driven training paradigm for this code optimization procedure, one could easily adapt findings from traditional machine learning techniques such as imitation learning, DAgger, and reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the first proof of concept of automated code optimization for autonomous driving in CARLA, showing that LangProp can generate interpretable and transparent driving policies that can be verified and improved in a metric- and data-driven way.

|**2024-01-18**|**Hacking Predictors Means Hacking Cars: Using Sensitivity Analysis to Identify Trajectory Prediction Vulnerabilities for Autonomous Driving Security**|Adversarial attacks on learning-based trajectory predictors have already been demonstrated. However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on trajectory predictor inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. We observe that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for Trajectron++ lie only within the most recent state history time point, while perturbation sensitivities for AgentFormer are spread across state histories over time. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models. Even though image maps may contribute slightly to the prediction output of both models, this result reveals that rather than being robust to adversarial image perturbations, trajectory predictors are susceptible to image attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how this vulnerability can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds. et.al.|[2401.10313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10313)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**Model-Assisted Learning for Adaptive Cooperative Perception of Connected Autonomous Vehicles**|Cooperative perception (CP) is a key technology to facilitate consistent and accurate situational awareness for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To tackle the network resource inefficiency issue in traditional broadcast-based CP, unicast-based CP has been proposed to associate CAV pairs for cooperative perception via vehicle-to-vehicle transmission. In this paper, we investigate unicast-based CP among CAV pairs. With the consideration of dynamic perception workloads and channel conditions due to vehicle mobility and dynamic radio resource availability, we propose an adaptive cooperative perception scheme for CAV pairs in a mixed-traffic autonomous driving scenario with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. We aim to determine when to switch between cooperative perception and stand-alone perception for each CAV pair, and allocate communication and computing resources to cooperative CAV pairs for maximizing the computing efficiency gain under perception task delay requirements. A model-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solution is developed, which integrates MARL for an adaptive CAV cooperation decision and an optimization model for communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving high computing efficiency gain, as compared with benchmark schemes. et.al.|[2401.10156](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10156)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**Importance-Aware Image Segmentation-based Semantic Communication for Autonomous Driving**|This article studies the problem of image segmentation-based semantic communication in autonomous driving. In real traffic scenes, detecting the key objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles) is more crucial than that of other objects to guarantee driving safety. Therefore, we propose a vehicular image segmentation-oriented semantic communication system, termed VIS-SemCom, where image segmentation features of important objects are transmitted to reduce transmission redundancy. First, to accurately extract image semantics, we develop a semantic codec based on Swin Transformer architecture, which expands the perceptual field thus improving the segmentation accuracy. Next, we propose a multi-scale semantic extraction scheme via assigning the number of Swin Transformer blocks for diverse resolution features, thus highlighting the important objects' accuracy. Furthermore, the importance-aware loss is invoked to emphasize the important objects, and an online hard sample mining (OHEM) strategy is proposed to handle small sample issues in the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VIS-SemCom can achieve a coding gain of nearly 6 dB with a 60% mean intersection over union (mIoU), reduce the transmitted data amount by up to 70% with a 60% mIoU, and improve the segmentation intersection over union (IoU) of important objects by 4%, compared to traditional transmission scheme. et.al.|[2401.10153](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10153)|null|

In total, SensoDat provides data from 81 different simulated sensors. Future research in the domain of SDCs does not necessarily depend on executing expensive test cases when using SensoDat. Furthermore, with the high amount and variety of sensor data, we think SensoDat can contribute to research, particularly for AI development, regression testing techniques for simulation-based SDC testing, flakiness in simulation, etc. Link to the dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10307479 et.al.|[2401.09808](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09808)|null|
|**2024-01-17**|**Enhancing Surveillance Camera FOV Quality via Semantic Line Detection and Classification with Deep Hough Transform**|The quality of recorded videos and images is significantly influenced by the camera's field of view (FOV). In critical applications like surveillance systems and self-driving cars, an inadequate FOV can give rise to severe safety and security concerns, including car accidents and thefts due to the failure to detect individuals and objects. The conventional methods for establishing the correct FOV heavily rely on human judgment and lack automated mechanisms to assess video and image quality based on FOV. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach that harnesses semantic line detection and classification alongside deep Hough transform to identify semantic lines, thus ensuring a suitable FOV by understanding 3D view through parallel lines. Our approach yields an effective F1 score of 0.729 on the public EgoCart dataset, coupled with a notably high median score in the line placement metric. We illustrate that our method offers a straightforward means of assessing the quality of the camera's field of view, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.8\%. This metric can serve as a proxy for evaluating the potential performance of video and image quality applications. et.al.|[2401.09515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09515)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**Stream Query Denoising for Vectorized HD Map Construction**|To enhance perception performance in complex and extensive scenarios within the realm of autonomous driving, there has been a noteworthy focus on temporal modeling, with a particular emphasis on streaming methods. The prevailing trend in streaming models involves the utilization of stream queries for the propagation of temporal information. Despite the prevalence of this approach, the direct application of the streaming paradigm to the construction of vectorized high-definition maps (HD-maps) fails to fully harness the inherent potential of temporal information. This paper introduces the Stream Query Denoising (SQD) strategy as a novel approach for temporal modeling in high-definition map (HD-map) construction. SQD is designed to facilitate the learning of temporal consistency among map elements within the streaming model. The methodology involves denoising the queries that have been perturbed by the addition of noise to the ground-truth information from the preceding frame. This denoising process aims to reconstruct the ground-truth information for the current frame, thereby simulating the prediction process inherent in stream queries. The SQD strategy can be applied to those streaming methods (e.g., StreamMapNet) to enhance the temporal modeling. The proposed SQD-MapNet is the StreamMapNet equipped with SQD. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 show that our method is remarkably superior to other existing methods across all settings of close range and long range. The code will be available soon. et.al.|[2401.09112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09112)|null|

Semantic segmentation is one of the key scene understanding tasks which is pivotal for several robotics applications including autonomous driving, domestic service robotics, last mile delivery, amongst many others. Semantic segmentation is a dense prediction task that aims to provide a scene representation in which each pixel of an image is assigned a semantic class label. Therefore, semantic segmentation considers the full scene context, incorporating the object category, location, and shape of all the scene elements, including the background. Numerous algorithms have been proposed for semantic segmentation over the years. However, the recent advances in deep learning combined with the boost in the computational capacity and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets have led to significant advances in semantic segmentation.

Integrating the capability of lightweight HD map construction at runtime into a self-driving system recently emerges as a promising direction. In this surge, vision-only perception stands out, as a camera rig can still perceive the stereo information, let alone its appealing signature of portability and economy. The latest MapTR architecture solves the online HD map construction task in an end-to-end fashion but its potential is yet to be explored. In this work, we present a full-scale upgrade of MapTR and propose MapNeXt, the next generation of HD map learning architecture, delivering major contributions from the model training and scaling perspectives. After shedding light on the training dynamics of MapTR and exploiting the supervision from map elements thoroughly, MapNeXt-Tiny raises the mAP of MapTR-Tiny from 49.0% to 54.8%, without any architectural modifications. Enjoying the fruit of map segmentation pre-training, MapNeXt-Base further lifts the mAP up to 63.9% that has already outperformed the prior art, a multi-modality MapTR, by 1.4% while being $\sim1.8\times$ faster. Towards pushing the performance frontier to the next level, we draw two conclusions on practical model scaling: increased query favors a larger decoder network for adequate digestion; a large backbone steadily promotes the final accuracy without bells and whistles. Building upon these two rules of thumb, MapNeXt-Huge achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging nuScenes benchmark.

|**2024-01-13**|**ACAV: A Framework for Automatic Causality Analysis in Autonomous Vehicle Accident Recordings**|The rapid progress of autonomous vehicles~(AVs) has brought the prospect of a driverless future closer than ever. Recent fatalities, however, have emphasized the importance of safety validation through large-scale testing. Multiple approaches achieve this fully automatically using high-fidelity simulators, i.e., by generating diverse driving scenarios and evaluating autonomous driving systems~(ADSs) against different test oracles. While effective at finding violations, these approaches do not identify the decisions and actions that \emph{caused} them -- information that is critical for improving the safety of ADSs. To address this challenge, we propose ACAV, an automated framework designed to conduct causality analysis for AV accident recordings in two stages. First, we apply feature extraction schemas based on the messages exchanged between ADS modules, and use a weighted voting method to discard frames of the recording unrelated to the accident. Second, we use safety specifications to identify safety-critical frames and deduce causal events by applying CAT -- our causal analysis tool -- to a station-time graph. We evaluate ACAV on the Apollo ADS, finding that it can identify five distinct types of causal events in 93.64% of 110 accident recordings generated by an AV testing engine. We further evaluated ACAV on 1206 accident recordings collected from versions of Apollo injected with specific faults, finding that it can correctly identify causal events in 96.44% of the accidents triggered by prediction errors, and 85.73% of the accidents triggered by planning errors. et.al.|[2401.07063](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07063)|null|

In this paper, we present UniVision, a simple and efficient framework that unifies two major tasks in vision-centric 3D perception, \ie, occupancy prediction and object detection. Specifically, we propose an explicit-implicit view transform module for complementary 2D-3D feature transformation. We propose a local-global feature extraction and fusion module for efficient and adaptive voxel and BEV feature extraction, enhancement, and interaction. Further, we propose a joint occupancy-detection data augmentation strategy and a progressive loss weight adjustment strategy which enables the efficiency and stability of the multi-task framework training. We conduct extensive experiments for different perception tasks on four public benchmarks, including nuScenes LiDAR segmentation, nuScenes detection, OpenOccupancy, and Occ3D.

In particular, knowing if pedestrians are going to cross in front of the ego-vehicle is core to performing safe and comfortable maneuvers. Creating accurate and fast models that predict such intentions from sequential images is challenging. A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diverse crossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios. We address this scarceness by introducing a framework, named ARCANE, which allows programmatically generating synthetic datasets consisting of C/NC video clip samples. As an example, we use ARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show how PedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, so enabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction.

|**2024-01-12**|**Real-time MPC with Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Driving using Safety Enhanced Collocation**|The autonomous driving industry is continuously dealing with more safety-critical scenarios, and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a powerful control strategy for handling such situations. However, standard safety constraints are not scalable and require a long NMPC horizon. Moreover, the adoption of NMPC in the automotive industry is limited by the heavy computation of numerical optimization routines. To address those issues, this paper presents a real-time capable NMPC for automated driving in urban environments, using control barrier functions (CBFs). Furthermore, the designed NMPC is based on a novel collocation transcription approach, named RESAFE/COL, that allows to reduce the number of optimization variables while still guaranteeing the continuous time (nonlinear) inequality constraints satisfaction, through regional convex hull approximation. RESAFE/COL is proven to be 5 times faster than multiple shooting and more tractable for embedded hardware without a decrease in the performance, nor accuracy and safety of the numerical solution. We validate our NMPC-CBF with RESAFE/COL approach with highly accurate digital twins of the vehicle and the urban environment and show the safe controller's ability to improve crash avoidance by 91%. et.al.|[2401.06648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06648)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**Enhancing Throughput for TTEthernet via Co-optimizing Routing and Scheduling: An Online Time-Varying Graph-based Method**|Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) has been widely applied in many scenarios such as industrial internet, automotive electronics, and aerospace, where offline routing and scheduling for TTEthernet has been largely investigated. However, predetermined routes and schedules cannot meet the demands in some agile scenarios, such as smart factories, autonomous driving, and satellite network switching, where the transmission requests join in and leave the network frequently. Thus, we study the online joint routing and scheduling problem for TTEthernet. However, balancing efficient and effective routing and scheduling in an online environment can be quite challenging. To ensure high-quality and fast routing and scheduling, we first design a time-slot expanded graph (TSEG) to model the available resources of TTEthernet over time. The fine-grained representation of TSEG allows us to select a time slot via selecting an edge, thus transforming the scheduling problem into a simple routing problem. Next, we design a dynamic weighting method for each edge in TSEG and further propose an algorithm to co-optimize the routing and scheduling. Our scheme enhances the TTEthernet throughput by co-optimizing the routing and scheduling to eliminate potential conflicts among flow requests, as compared to existing methods. The extensive simulation results show that our scheme runs >400 times faster than standard solutions (i.e., ILP solver), while the gap is only 2% to the optimally scheduled number of flow requests. Besides, as compared to existing schemes, our method can improve the successfully scheduled number of flows by more than 18%. et.al.|[2401.06579](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06579)|null|

Key to this system is 3D object detection methods, that utilize vehicle-mounted sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to identify the size, category, and location of nearby objects. Despite the surge in 3D object detection methods aimed at enhancing detection precision and efficiency, there is a gap in the literature that systematically examines their resilience against environmental variations, noise, and weather changes. This study emphasizes the importance of robustness, alongside accuracy and latency, in evaluating perception systems under practical scenarios. Our work presents an extensive survey of camera-based, LiDAR-based, and multimodal 3D object detection algorithms, thoroughly evaluating their trade-off between accuracy, latency, and robustness, particularly on datasets like KITTI-C and nuScenes-C to ensure fair comparisons. Among these,multimodal 3D detection approaches exhibit superior robustness and a novel taxonomy is introduced to reorganize its literature for enhanced clarity. This survey aims to offer a more practical perspective on the current capabilities and constraints of 3D object detection algorithms in real-world applications, thus steering future research towards robustness-centric advancements et.al.|[2401.06542](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06542)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**Personalized Reinforcement Learning with a Budget of Policies**|Personalization in machine learning (ML) tailors models' decisions to the individual characteristics of users. While this approach has seen success in areas like recommender systems, its expansion into high-stakes fields such as healthcare and autonomous driving is hindered by the extensive regulatory approval processes involved. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework termed represented Markov Decision Processes (r-MDPs) that is designed to balance the need for personalization with the regulatory constraints. In an r-MDP, we cater to a diverse user population, each with unique preferences, through interaction with a small set of representative policies. Our objective is twofold: efficiently match each user to an appropriate representative policy and simultaneously optimize these policies to maximize overall social welfare. We develop two deep reinforcement learning algorithms that efficiently solve r-MDPs. These algorithms draw inspiration from the principles of classic K-means clustering and are underpinned by robust theoretical foundations. Our empirical investigations, conducted across a variety of simulated environments, showcase the algorithms' ability to facilitate meaningful personalization even under constrained policy budgets. Furthermore, they demonstrate scalability, efficiently adapting to larger policy budgets. et.al.|[2401.06514](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06514)|**[link](https://github.com/dimonenka/rl_policy_budget)**|

|**2024-01-10**|**Autonomous Navigation of Tractor-Trailer Vehicles through Roundabout Intersections**|In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of autonomous driving with the aim of increasing safety and efficiency. However, research that focuses on tractor-trailer vehicles is relatively sparse. Due to the physical characteristics and articulated joints, such vehicles require tailored models. While turning, the back wheels of the trailer turn at a tighter radius and the truck often has to deviate from the centre of the lane to accommodate this. Due to the lack of publicly available models, this work develops truck and trailer models using the high-fidelity simulation software CARLA, together with several roundabout scenarios, to establish a baseline dataset for benchmarks. Using a twin-q soft actor-critic algorithm, we train a quasi-end-to-end autonomous driving model which is able to achieve a 73% success rate on different roundabouts. et.al.|[2401.04980](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04980)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**Latency-aware Road Anomaly Segmentation in Videos: A Photorealistic Dataset and New Metrics**|In the past several years, road anomaly segmentation is actively explored in the academia and drawing growing attention in the industry. The rationale behind is straightforward: if the autonomous car can brake before hitting an anomalous object, safety is promoted. However, this rationale naturally calls for a temporally informed setting while existing methods and benchmarks are designed in an unrealistic frame-wise manner. To bridge this gap, we contribute the first video anomaly segmentation dataset for autonomous driving. Since placing various anomalous objects on busy roads and annotating them in every frame are dangerous and expensive, we resort to synthetic data. To improve the relevance of this synthetic dataset to real-world applications, we train a generative adversarial network conditioned on rendering G-buffers for photorealism enhancement. Our dataset consists of 120,000 high-resolution frames at a 60 FPS framerate, as recorded in 7 different towns. As an initial benchmarking, we provide baselines using latest supervised and unsupervised road anomaly segmentation methods. Apart from conventional ones, we focus on two new metrics: temporal consistency and latencyaware streaming accuracy. We believe the latter is valuable as it measures whether an anomaly segmentation algorithm can truly prevent a car from crashing in a temporally informed setting. et.al.|[2401.04942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04942)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**Learning Racing From an AI Coach: Effects of Multimodal Autonomous Driving Explanations on Driving Performance, Cognitive Load, Expertise, and Trust**|In a pre-post experiment (n = 41), we test the impact of an AI Coach's explanatory communications modeled after the instructions of human driving experts. Participants were divided into four (4) groups to assess two (2) dimensions of the AI coach's explanations: information type ('what' and 'why'-type explanations) and presentation modality (auditory and visual). We directly compare how AI Coaching sessions employing these techniques impact driving performance, cognitive load, confidence, expertise, and trust in an observation learning context. Through interviews, we delineate the learning process of our participants. Results show that an AI driving coach can be useful for teaching performance driving skills to novices. Comparing between groups, we find the type and modality of information influences performance outcomes. We attribute differences to how information directed attention, mitigated uncertainty, and influenced overload experienced by participants. These, in turn, affected how successfully participants were able to learn. Results suggest efficient, modality-appropriate explanations should be opted for when designing effective HMI communications that can instruct without overwhelming. Further, they support the need to align communications with human learning and cognitive processes. Results are synthesized into eight design implications for future autonomous vehicle HMI and AI coach design. et.al.|[2401.04206](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04206)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**RoboFusion: Towards Robust Multi-Modal 3D obiect Detection via SAM**|Multi-modal 3D object detectors are dedicated to exploring secure and reliable perception systems for autonomous driving (AD). However, while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on clean benchmark datasets, they tend to overlook the complexity and harsh conditions of real-world environments. Meanwhile, with the emergence of visual foundation models (VFMs), opportunities and challenges are presented for improving the robustness and generalization of multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose RoboFusion, a robust framework that leverages VFMs like SAM to tackle out-of-distribution (OOD) noise scenarios. We first adapt the original SAM for autonomous driving scenarios named SAM-AD. To align SAM or SAM-AD with multi-modal methods, we then introduce AD-FPN for upsampling the image features extracted by SAM. We employ wavelet decomposition to denoise the depth-guided images for further noise reduction and weather interference. Lastly, we employ self-attention mechanisms to adaptively reweight the fused features, enhancing informative features while suppressing excess noise. In summary, our RoboFusion gradually reduces noise by leveraging the generalization and robustness of VFMs, thereby enhancing the resilience of multi-modal 3D object detection. Consequently, our RoboFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in noisy scenarios, as demonstrated by the KITTI-C and nuScenes-C benchmarks. et.al.|[2401.03907](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03907)|null|

UFO detection is challenging in that existing 3D object detectors encounter extremely hard challenges in both 3D localization and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. To tackle these challenges, we suggest a new UFO detection framework including three tasks: evaluation protocol, methodology, and benchmark. The evaluation includes a new approach to measure the performance on our goal, i.e. both localization and OOD detection of UFOs. The methodology includes practical techniques to enhance the performance of our goal. The benchmark is composed of the KITTI Misc benchmark and our additional synthetic benchmark for modeling a more diverse range of UFOs. The proposed framework consistently enhances performance by a large margin across all four baseline detectors: SECOND, PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and PartA2, giving insight for future work on UFO detection in the wild. et.al.|[2401.03846](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03846)|null|

WidthFormer is computationally efficient, robust and does not require any special engineering effort to deploy. In this work, we propose a novel 3D positional encoding mechanism capable of accurately encapsulating 3D geometric information, which enables our model to generate high-quality BEV representations with only a single transformer decoder layer. This mechanism is also beneficial for existing sparse 3D object detectors. Inspired by the recently-proposed works, we further improve our model's efficiency by vertically compressing the image features when serving as attention keys and values. We also introduce two modules to compensate for potential information loss due to feature compression. Experimental evaluation on the widely-used nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark demonstrates that our method outperforms previous approaches across different 3D detection architectures. More importantly, our model is highly efficient. For example, when using $256\times 704$ input images, it achieves 1.5 ms and 2.8 ms latency on NVIDIA 3090 GPU and Horizon Journey-5 edge computing chips, respectively. Furthermore, WidthFormer also exhibits strong robustness to different degrees of camera perturbations.

|**2024-01-08**|**Safe Chance-constrained Model Predictive Control under Gaussian Mixture Model Uncertainty**|We present a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) framework under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the uncertainty that arises from predicting future behaviors of moving obstacles, which may exhibit multiple modes (for example, turning left or right). To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators. et.al.|[2401.03799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03799)|null|

We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call "NeRFmentation", trains NeRFs on each scene in the dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving set, and our own synthetic test set. et.al.|[2401.03771](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03771)|null|

This paper introduces DME-Driver, a new autonomous driving system that enhances the performance and reliability of autonomous driving system. DME-Driver utilizes a powerful vision language model as the decision-maker and a planning-oriented perception model as the control signal generator. To ensure explainable and reliable driving decisions, the logical decision-maker is constructed based on a large vision language model. This model follows the logic employed by experienced human drivers and makes decisions in a similar manner. On the other hand, the generation of accurate control signals relies on precise and detailed environmental perception, which is where 3D scene perception models excel. Therefore, a planning oriented perception model is employed as the signal generator. It translates the logical decisions made by the decision-maker into accurate control signals for the self-driving cars. To effectively train the proposed model, a new dataset for autonomous driving was created. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of human driver behaviors and their underlying motivations. By leveraging this dataset, our model achieves high-precision planning accuracy through a logical thinking process. et.al.|[2401.03641](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03641)|null|

Amidst the evolving landscape of data-driven methodologies, enhancing decision-making performance in complex scenarios has emerged as a prominent research focus.

To address these challenges, we introduce DDM-Lag, a Diffusion Decision Model,augmented with Lagrangian-based safety enhancements.In our approach, the autonomous driving decision-making conundrum is conceptualized as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We have crafted an Actor-Critic framework, wherein the diffusion model is employed as the actor,facilitating policy exploration and learning. The integration of safety constraints in the CMDP and the adoption of a Lagrangian relaxation-based policy optimization technique ensure enhanced decision safety. A PID controller is employed for the stable updating of model parameters. The effectiveness of DDM-Lag is evaluated through different driving tasks, showcasing improvements in decision-making safety and overall performance compared to baselines. et.al.|[2401.03629](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03629)|null|
|**2024-01-07**|**Text-Driven Traffic Anomaly Detection with Temporal High-Frequency Modeling in Driving Videos**|Traffic anomaly detection (TAD) in driving videos is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Previous single-stage TAD methods primarily rely on frame prediction, making them vulnerable to interference from dynamic backgrounds induced by the rapid movement of the dashboard camera. While two-stage TAD methods appear to be a natural solution to mitigate such interference by pre-extracting background-independent features (such as bounding boxes and optical flow) using perceptual algorithms, they are susceptible to the performance of first-stage perceptual algorithms and may result in error propagation. In this paper, we introduce TTHF, a novel single-stage method aligning video clips with text prompts, offering a new perspective on traffic anomaly detection. Unlike previous approaches, the supervised signal of our method is derived from languages rather than orthogonal one-hot vectors, providing a more comprehensive representation. Further, concerning visual representation, we propose to model the high frequency of driving videos in the temporal domain. This modeling captures the dynamic changes of driving scenes, enhances the perception of driving behavior, and significantly improves the detection of traffic anomalies. In addition, to better perceive various types of traffic anomalies, we carefully design an attentive anomaly focusing mechanism that visually and linguistically guides the model to adaptively focus on the visual context of interest, thereby facilitating the detection of traffic anomalies. It is shown that our proposed TTHF achieves promising performance, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by +5.4% AUC on the DoTA dataset and achieving high generalization on the DADA dataset. et.al.|[2401.03522](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03522)|null|

However, the accuracy of existing wireless SLAM schemes is limited because the antenna gain is constrained given the cost budget due to the expensive hardware components such as phase arrays. To address this issue, we propose a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-aided SLAM system in this paper. The RHS is a novel type of low-cost antenna that can cut down the hardware cost by replacing phased arrays in conventional SLAM systems. However, compared with a phased array where the phase shifts of parallelfed signals are adjusted, the RHS exhibits a different radiation model because its amplitude-controlled radiation elements are series-fed by surface waves, implying that traditional schemes cannot be applied directly. To address this challenge, we propose an RHS-aided beam steering method for sensing the surrounding environment and design the corresponding SLAM algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve more than there times the localization accuracy that traditional wireless SLAM with the same cost achieves. et.al.|[2401.03453](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03453)|null|
|**2024-01-06**|**DistFormer: Enhancing Local and Global Features for Monocular Per-Object Distance Estimation**|Accurate per-object distance estimation is crucial in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. Existing approaches rely on two scales: local information (i.e., the bounding box proportions) or global information, which encodes the semantics of the scene as well as the spatial relations with neighboring objects. However, these approaches may struggle with long-range objects and in the presence of strong occlusions or unusual visual patterns. In this respect, our work aims to strengthen both local and global cues. Our architecture -- named DistFormer -- builds upon three major components acting jointly: i) a robust context encoder extracting fine-grained per-object representations; ii) a masked encoder-decoder module exploiting self-supervision to promote the learning of useful per-object features; iii) a global refinement module that aggregates object representations and computes a joint, spatially-consistent estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of DistFormer, we conduct experiments on the standard KITTI dataset and the large-scale NuScenes and MOTSynth datasets. Such datasets cover various indoor/outdoor environments, changing weather conditions, appearances, and camera viewpoints. Our comprehensive analysis shows that DistFormer outperforms existing methods.

Despite the advantages of learning-based scene flow estimation techniques, their domain specificity and limited generalizability across varied scenarios pose challenges. In contrast, non-learning optimization-based methods, incorporating robust priors or regularization, offer competitive scene flow estimation performance, require no training, and show extensive applicability across datasets, but suffer from lengthy inference times. In this paper, we present OptFlow, a fast optimization-based scene flow estimation method. Without relying on learning or any labeled datasets, OptFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance for scene flow estimation on popular autonomous driving benchmarks. It integrates a local correlation weight matrix for correspondence matching, an adaptive correspondence threshold limit for nearest-neighbor search, and graph prior rigidity constraints, resulting in expedited convergence and improved point correspondence identification. Moreover, we demonstrate how integrating a point cloud registration function within our objective function bolsters accuracy and differentiates between static and dynamic points without relying on external odometry data. Consequently, OptFlow outperforms the baseline graph-prior method by approximately 20% and the Neural Scene Flow Prior method by 5%-7% in accuracy, all while offering the fastest inference time among all non-learning scene flow estimation methods. et.al.|[2401.02550](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02550)|null|

While there are several approaches for testing and analysing them in high-fidelity simulators, ADSs may still encounter additional critical scenarios beyond those covered once they are deployed on real roads. An additional level of confidence can be established by monitoring and enforcing critical properties when the ADS is running. Existing work, however, is only able to monitor simple safety properties (e.g., avoidance of collisions) and is limited to blunt enforcement mechanisms such as hitting the emergency brakes. In this work, we propose REDriver, a general and modular approach to runtime enforcement, in which users can specify a broad range of properties (e.g., national traffic laws) in a specification language based on signal temporal logic (STL). REDriver monitors the planned trajectory of the ADS based on a quantitative semantics of STL, and uses a gradient-driven algorithm to repair the trajectory when a violation of the specification is likely. We implemented REDriver for two versions of Apollo (i.e., a popular ADS), and subjected it to a benchmark of violations of Chinese traffic laws. The results show that REDriver significantly improves Apollo's conformance to the specification with minimal overhead. et.al.|[2401.02253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02253)|null|

In this paper, we propose an efficient inexact model predictive control (MPC) strategy for autonomous miniature racing with inherent robustness properties. We rely on a feasible sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm capable of generating feasible intermediate iterates such that the solver can be stopped after any number of iterations, without jeopardizing recursive feasibility. In this way, we provide a strategy that computes suboptimal and yet feasible solutions with a computational footprint that is much lower than state-of-the-art methods based on the computation of locally optimal solutions. Under suitable assumptions on the terminal set and on the controllability properties of the system, we can state that, for any sufficiently small disturbance affecting the system's dynamics, recursive feasibility can be guaranteed. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in simulation and by deploying it onto a physical experiment with autonomous miniature race cars. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, using the feasible SQP method, a feasible solution can be obtained with moderate additional computational effort compared to strategies that resort to early termination without providing a feasible solution. At the same time, the proposed method is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art solver Ipopt. et.al.|[2401.02194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02194)|null|

For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however, the effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different modalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple levels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network (CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs interaction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly guided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary Reasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship between multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and channel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual and detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module and Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary supervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the segmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. et.al.|[2401.01544](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01544)|null|

|**2024-01-02**|**Off-Road LiDAR Intensity Based Semantic Segmentation**|LiDAR is used in autonomous driving to provide 3D spatial information and enable accurate perception in off-road environments, aiding in obstacle detection, mapping, and path planning. Learning-based LiDAR semantic segmentation utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify objects and regions in LiDAR point clouds. Learning-based models struggle in off-road environments due to the presence of diverse objects with varying colors, textures, and undefined boundaries, which can lead to difficulties in accurately classifying and segmenting objects using traditional geometric-based features. In this paper, we address this problem by harnessing the LiDAR intensity parameter to enhance object segmentation in off-road environments. Our approach was evaluated in the RELLIS-3D data set and yielded promising results as a preliminary analysis with improved mIoU for classes "puddle" and "grass" compared to more complex deep learning-based benchmarks. The methodology was evaluated for compatibility across both Velodyne and Ouster LiDAR systems, assuring its cross-platform applicability. This analysis advocates for the incorporation of calibrated intensity as a supplementary input, aiming to enhance the prediction accuracy of learning based semantic segmentation frameworks. https://github.com/MOONLABIISERB/lidar-intensity-predictor/tree/main et.al.|[2401.01439](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01439)|**[link](https://github.com/moonlabiiserb/lidar-intensity-predictor)**|
|**2024-01-02**|**Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking with Modality Prompt**|RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics, surveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully explore the spatial information between the template and the search region and locate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT trackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either ignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and training. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the latter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking framework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure and captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the two-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template respectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal information and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition, we design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two branches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales. Extensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed. et.al.|[2401.01244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01244)|null|

The fusion of a camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) can make up for the shortcomings of a signal sensor, which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of localization in challenging environments. Robust tracking and accurate inertial parameter estimation are the basis for the stable operation of the system. This article presents PLE-SLAM, an entirely precise and real-time visual-inertial SLAM algorithm based on point-line features and efficient IMU initialization. First, we introduce line features in a point-based visual-inertial SLAM system. We use parallel computing methods to extract features and compute descriptors to ensure real-time performance. Second, the proposed system estimates gyroscope bias with rotation pre-integration and point and line observations. Accelerometer bias and gravity direction are solved by an analytical method. After initialization, all inertial parameters are refined through maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Moreover, we open a dynamic feature elimination thread to improve the adaptability to dynamic environments and use CNN, bag-of-words and GNN to detect loops and match features. Excellent wide baseline matching capability of DNN-based matching method and illumination robustness significantly improve loop detection recall and loop inter-frame pose estimation. The front-end and back-end are designed for hardware acceleration. The experiments are performed on public datasets, and the results show that the proposed system is one of the state-of-the-art methods in complex scenarios. et.al.|[2401.01081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01081)|**[link](https://github.com/hjmgarmin/ple-slam)**|

Meanwhile, under the pre-existing two dimensional image retrieval method, some problems may arise with scene retrieval, such as lack of global feature representation and subpar text retrieval ability. To address these issues, we have proposed \textbf{BEV-CLIP}, the first multimodal Bird's-Eye View(BEV) retrieval methodology that utilizes descriptive text as an input to retrieve corresponding scenes. This methodology applies the semantic feature extraction abilities of a large language model (LLM) to facilitate zero-shot retrieval of extensive text descriptions, and incorporates semi-structured information from a knowledge graph to improve the semantic richness and variety of the language embedding. Our experiments result in 87.66% accuracy on NuScenes dataset in text-to-BEV feature retrieval. The demonstrated cases in our paper support that our retrieval method is also indicated to be effective in identifying certain long-tail corner scenes. et.al.|[2401.01065](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01065)|null|

However, existing research typically focuses on limited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is crucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce NuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17 subtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal, multi-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level. To obtain NuInstruct, we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate instruction-response pairs automatically, which is inspired by the driving logical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM, an end-to-end method for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates multi-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs' capabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module is a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct demonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g. around 9% improvement on various tasks. We plan to release our NuInstruct for future research development. et.al.|[2401.00988](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00988)|**[link](https://github.com/xmed-lab/nuinstruct)**|

The challenges introduced by the ego-motion of the cameras, radial distortion in fisheye lenses, and the need for temporal consistency make the task more complicated, rendering traditional and standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches less effective. The consequent laborious data labeling, representation of diverse and uncommon scenarios, and extensive data capture requirements underscore the imperative of synthetic data for improving machine learning model performance. To this end, we employ the PD-WoodScape synthetic dataset developed by Parallel Domain, alongside the WoodScape fisheye dataset. Thus, we present the WoodScape fisheye motion segmentation challenge for autonomous driving, held as part of the CVPR 2023 Workshop on Omnidirectional Computer Vision (OmniCV). As one of the first competitions focused on fisheye motion segmentation, we aim to explore and evaluate the potential and impact of utilizing synthetic data in this domain. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis on the competition which attracted the participation of 112 global teams and a total of 234 submissions. This study delineates the complexities inherent in the task of motion segmentation, emphasizes the significance of fisheye datasets, articulate the necessity for synthetic datasets and the resultant domain gap they engender, outlining the foundational blueprint for devising successful solutions.

|**2024-01-01**|**Socially Compliant Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Application to Eco-Driving**|Control design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has mostly focused on achieving a prespecified goal for an individually controlled AV or for a swarm of cooperatively controlled AVs. However, the impact of autonomous driving on human-driven vehicles (HVs) has been largely ignored in AV controller synthesis, which could result in egoistic AV behavior detrimental to the safety of passengers and surrounding traffic. In this study we develop a general framework for socially compliant control design of AVs with a useful metric of social psychology, called social value orientation (SVO), allowing AVs to leverage their impact on the behavior of the following HVs. This is critical since AVs that behave in a socially compliant manner enable human drivers to comprehend their actions and respond appropriately. Within the proposed framework, we define the utilities of the controlled AV and its following vehicle, to be maximized in a weighted fashion determined by the AV's SVO. The utility maximization covers an array of design objectives given the goal of the AV and the benefits for the following HV stemming from the courtesy of socially compliant AV controls. An optimal control problem is then formulated to maximize the utility function defined, which is numerically solved using Pontryagin's minimum principle with optimality guarantees. The methodology developed is applied to synthesize socially compliant control for eco-driving of AVs. A set of numerical results are presented to show the mechanism and effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world experimental data collected on Highway 55 in Minnesota. et.al.|[2401.00830](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00830)|null|

To promote the autonomous vehicles to spread widely, it is important to address safety issues on this technology. Among various safety concerns, the sensor blockage problem by severe weather conditions can be one of the most frequent threats for multi-task learning based perception algorithms during autonomous driving. To handle this problem, the importance of the generation of proper datasets is becoming more significant. In this paper, a synthetic road dataset with sensor blockage generated from real road dataset BDD100K is suggested in the format of BDD100K annotation. Rain streaks for each frame were made by an experimentally established equation and translated utilizing the image-to-image translation network based on style transfer. Using this dataset, the degradation of the diverse multi-task networks for autonomous driving, such as lane detection, driving area segmentation, and traffic object detection, has been thoroughly evaluated and analyzed. The tendency of the performance degradation of deep neural network-based perception systems for autonomous vehicle has been analyzed in depth.

|**2023-12-31**|**Controllable Safety-Critical Closed-loop Traffic Simulation via Guided Diffusion**|Evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle planning algorithms necessitates simulating long-tail traffic scenarios. Traditional methods for generating safety-critical scenarios often fall short in realism and controllability. Furthermore, these techniques generally neglect the dynamics of agent interactions. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel closed-loop simulation framework rooted in guided diffusion models. Our approach yields two distinct advantages: 1) the generation of realistic long-tail scenarios that closely emulate real-world conditions, and 2) enhanced controllability, enabling more comprehensive and interactive evaluations. We achieve this through novel guidance objectives that enhance road progress while lowering collision and off-road rates. We develop a novel approach to simulate safety-critical scenarios through an adversarial term in the denoising process, which allows the adversarial agent to challenge a planner with plausible maneuvers, while all agents in the scene exhibit reactive and realistic behaviors. We validate our framework empirically using the NuScenes dataset, demonstrating improvements in both realism and controllability. These findings affirm that guided diffusion models provide a robust and versatile foundation for safety-critical, interactive traffic simulation, extending their utility across the broader landscape of autonomous driving.

Learning-based planners suffer from overfitting and poor long-tail performance. On the other hand, rule-based planners generalize well, but might fail to handle scenarios that require complex driving maneuvers. To address these limitations, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the common-sense reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT4 and Llama2 to generate plans for self-driving vehicles. In particular, we develop a novel hybrid planner that leverages a conventional rule-based planner in conjunction with an LLM-based planner. Guided by commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs, our approach navigates complex scenarios which existing planners struggle with, produces well-reasoned outputs while also remaining grounded through working alongside the rule-based approach. Through extensive evaluation on the nuPlan benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all existing pure learning- and rule-based methods across most metrics.

To support such artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) services, future communication systems should fulfill much more stringent requirements (including data rate, throughput, latency, etc.) with limited yet precious spectrum resources. To tackle this challenge, semantic communication (SemCom), dramatically reducing resource consumption via extracting and transmitting semantics, has been deemed as a revolutionary communication scheme. The advanced GAI algorithms facilitate SemCom on sophisticated intelligence for model training, knowledge base construction and channel adaption. Furthermore, GAI algorithms also play an important role in the management of SemCom networks. In this survey, we first overview the basics of GAI and SemCom as well as the synergies of the two technologies.

Visual autonomous driving applications require features encompassing semantics, 3D geometry, and temporal information simultaneously for joint perception, prediction, and planning, posing dramatic challenges for pre-training. To resolve this, we bring up a new pre-training task termed as visual point cloud forecasting - predicting future point clouds from historical visual input. The key merit of this task captures the synergic learning of semantics, 3D structures, and temporal dynamics. Hence it shows superiority in various downstream tasks. To cope with this new problem, we present ViDAR, a general model to pre-train downstream visual encoders. It first extracts historical embeddings by the encoder. These representations are then transformed to 3D geometric space via a novel Latent Rendering operator for future point cloud prediction. Experiments show significant gain in downstream tasks, e.g., 3.1% NDS on 3D detection, ~10% error reduction on motion forecasting, and ~15% less collision rate on planning. et.al.|[2312.17655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17655)|**[link](https://github.com/opendrivelab/vidar)**|

|**2023-12-29**|**Fully Sparse 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction**|Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving. Previous methods typically constructs a dense 3D volume, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene, which results in a high computational cost. Furthermore, these methods are limited to semantic occupancy and fail to differentiate between distinct instances. To exploit the sparsity property and ensure instance-awareness, we introduce a novel fully sparse panoptic occupancy network, termed SparseOcc. SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from visual inputs. Subsequently, it employs sparse instance queries to predict each object instance from the sparse 3D representation. These instance queries interact with 2D features via mask-guided sparse sampling, thereby circumventing the need for costly dense features or global attention. Additionally, we have established the first-ever vision-centric panoptic occupancy benchmark. SparseOcc demonstrates its efficacy on the Occ3D-nus dataset by achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 26.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 25.4 FPS. By incorporating temporal modeling from the preceding 8 frames, SparseOcc further improves its performance, achieving 30.9 mIoU without whistles and bells.

However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the ``person'' category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19\% and 29.20\%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model.

Popular multi-modal learning approach Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) has popularized contrastive symmetric loss using batch construction technique by applying it to multi-modal domains of text and image. We apply this approach to the domains of 2D image and 3D LiDAR points on the task of cross-modal localization. Our method is explained as follows: A batch of N (image, LiDAR) pairs is constructed so as to predict what is the right match between N X N possible pairings across the batch by jointly training an image encoder and LiDAR encoder to learn a multi-modal embedding space. In this way, the cosine similarity between N positive pairings is maximized, whereas that between the remaining negative pairings is minimized. Finally, over the obtained similarity scores, a symmetric cross-entropy loss is optimized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply batched loss approach to a cross-modal setting of image & LiDAR data and also to show Zero-shot transfer in a visual localization setting. We conduct extensive analyses on standard autonomous driving datasets such as KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art recall@1 accuracy on the KITTI-360 dataset by 22.4%, using only perspective images, in contrast to the state-of-the-art approach, which utilizes the more informative fisheye images. Additionally, this superior performance is achieved without resorting to complex architectures. Moreover, we demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of our model and we beat SOTA by 8% without even training on it.

There are many scenarios ranging from the classification of rare diseases to language modelling of uncommon languages where the availability of large datasets is rare. Similarly, for more broader scenarios like self-driving, an autonomous vehicle needs to be trained to handle every situation well. This requires training the ML model on a variety of tasks with good quality data. But often times, we find that the data distribution across various tasks is skewed, i.e.the data follows a long-tail distribution. This leads to the model performing well on some tasks and not performing so well on others leading to model robustness issues. Meta-learning has recently emerged as a potential learning paradigm which can effectively learn from one task and generalize that learning to unseen tasks. In this study, we aim to exploit external knowledge of task relations to improve training stability via effective mini-batching of tasks. We hypothesize that selecting a diverse set of tasks in a mini-batch will lead to a better estimate of the full gradient and hence will lead to a reduction of noise in training. et.al.|[2312.16612](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16612)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**LaneSegNet: Map Learning with Lane Segment Perception for Autonomous Driving**|A map, as crucial information for downstream applications of an autonomous driving system, is usually represented in lanelines or centerlines. However, existing literature on map learning primarily focuses on either detecting geometry-based lanelines or perceiving topology relationships of centerlines. Both of these methods ignore the intrinsic relationship of lanelines and centerlines, that lanelines bind centerlines. While simply predicting both types of lane in one model is mutually excluded in learning objective, we advocate lane segment as a new representation that seamlessly incorporates both geometry and topology information. Thus, we introduce LaneSegNet, the first end-to-end mapping network generating lane segments to obtain a complete representation of the road structure. Our algorithm features two key modifications. One is a lane attention module to capture pivotal region details within the long-range feature space. Another is an identical initialization strategy for reference points, which enhances the learning of positional priors for lane attention. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, LaneSegNet outperforms previous counterparts by a substantial gain across three tasks, \textit{i.e.}, map element detection (+4.8 mAP), centerline perception (+6.9 DET $_l$ ), and the newly defined one, lane segment perception (+5.6 mAP).

However, it is challenging for the traditional hybrid strategy based on fixed coefficients to adapt to mixed traffic flow scenarios, which may decrease the performance and even lead to accidents. To address the above problems, a hybrid car following strategy based on an adaptive Kalman Filter is proposed by regarding CACC and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Different from traditional hybrid strategy based on fixed coefficients, the Kalman gain H, using as an adaptive coefficient, is derived from multi-timestep predictions and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions.

To address this problem, learning-based models have emerged as promising solutions in recent years, with unparalleled potential to map low-fidelity simulated sensor data into highly realistic outputs. Motivated by this potential, this paper focuses on sim-to-real mapping of Lidar point clouds, a widely used perception sensor in automated driving systems. We introduce a novel Contrastive-Learning-based Sim-to-Real mapping framework, namely CLS2R, inspired by the recent advancements in image-to-image translation techniques. The proposed CLS2R framework employs a lossless representation of Lidar point clouds, considering all essential Lidar attributes such as depth, reflectance, and raydrop. We extensively evaluate the proposed framework, comparing it with state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods using a diverse range of metrics to assess realness, faithfulness, and the impact on the performance of a downstream task. Our results show that CLS2R demonstrates superior performance across nearly all metrics.

|**2023-12-25**|**A Survey on Open-Set Image Recognition**|Open-set image recognition (OSR) aims to both classify known-class samples and identify unknown-class samples in the testing set, which supports robust classifiers in many realistic applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, security monitoring, etc. In recent years, open-set recognition methods have achieved more and more attention, since it is usually difficult to obtain holistic information about the open world for model training. In this paper, we aim to summarize the up-to-date development of recent OSR methods, considering their rapid development in recent two or three years. Specifically, we firstly introduce a new taxonomy, under which we comprehensively review the existing DNN-based OSR methods. Then, we compare the performances of some typical and state-of-the-art OSR methods on both coarse-grained datasets and fine-grained datasets under both standard-dataset setting and cross-dataset setting, and further give the analysis of the comparison. Finally, we discuss some open issues and possible future directions in this community. et.al.|[2312.15571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15571)|null|
|**2023-12-23**|**Pre-trained Trojan Attacks for Visual Recognition**|Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) have become a dominant component due to their exceptional performance when fine-tuned for downstream tasks. However, the presence of backdoors within PVMs poses significant threats. Unfortunately, existing studies primarily focus on backdooring PVMs for the classification task, neglecting potential inherited backdoors in downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. In this paper, we propose the Pre-trained Trojan attack, which embeds backdoors into a PVM, enabling attacks across various downstream vision tasks. We highlight the challenges posed by cross-task activation and shortcut connections in successful backdoor attacks. To achieve effective trigger activation in diverse tasks, we stylize the backdoor trigger patterns with class-specific textures, enhancing the recognition of task-irrelevant low-level features associated with the target class in the trigger pattern. Moreover, we address the issue of shortcut connections by introducing a context-free learning pipeline for poison training. In this approach, triggers without contextual backgrounds are directly utilized as training data, diverging from the conventional use of clean images. Consequently, we establish a direct shortcut from the trigger to the target class, mitigating the shortcut connection issue. We conducted extensive experiments to thoroughly validate the effectiveness of our attacks on downstream detection and segmentation tasks. Additionally, we showcase the potential of our approach in more practical scenarios, including large vision models and 3D object detection in autonomous driving. This paper aims to raise awareness of the potential threats associated with applying PVMs in practical scenarios. Our codes will be available upon paper publication. et.al.|[2312.15172](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15172)|null|
|**2023-12-23**|**Scaling Is All You Need: Training Strong Policies for Autonomous Driving with JAX-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning**|Reinforcement learning has been used to train policies that outperform even the best human players in various games. However, a large amount of data is needed to achieve good performance, which in turn requires building large-scale frameworks and simulators. In this paper, we study how large-scale reinforcement learning can be applied to autonomous driving, analyze how the resulting policies perform as the experiment size is scaled, and what the most important factors contributing to policy performance are. To do this, we first introduce a hardware-accelerated autonomous driving simulator, which allows us to efficiently collect experience from billions of agent steps. This simulator is paired with a large-scale, multi-GPU reinforcement learning framework. We demonstrate that simultaneous scaling of dataset size, model size, and agent steps trained provides increasingly strong driving policies in regard to collision, traffic rule violations, and progress. In particular, our best policy reduces the failure rate by 57% while improving progress by 23% compared to the current state-of-the-art machine learning policies for autonomous driving. et.al.|[2312.15122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15122)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**Lift-Attend-Splat: Bird's-eye-view camera-lidar fusion using transformers**|Combining complementary sensor modalities is crucial to providing robust perception for safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving (AD). Recent state-of-the-art camera-lidar fusion methods for AD rely on monocular depth estimation which is a notoriously difficult task compared to using depth information from the lidar directly. Here, we find that this approach does not leverage depth as expected and show that naively improving depth estimation does not lead to improvements in object detection performance and that, strikingly, removing depth estimation altogether does not degrade object detection performance. This suggests that relying on monocular depth could be an unnecessary architectural bottleneck during camera-lidar fusion. In this work, we introduce a novel fusion method that bypasses monocular depth estimation altogether and instead selects and fuses camera and lidar features in a bird's-eye-view grid using a simple attention mechanism. We show that our model can modulate its use of camera features based on the availability of lidar features and that it yields better 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset than baselines relying on monocular depth estimation. et.al.|[2312.14919](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14919)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**Explainable Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection with Transformer-Based Saliency Maps**|Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various computer vision tasks, including 3D object detection. However, their end-to-end implementation also makes ViTs less explainable, which can be a challenge for deploying them in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where it is important for authorities, developers, and users to understand the model's reasoning behind its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating saliency maps for a DetR-like ViT with multiple camera inputs used for 3D object detection. Our method is based on the raw attention and is more efficient than gradient-based methods. We evaluate the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset using extensive perturbation tests and show that it outperforms other explainability methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics. We also demonstrate the importance of aggregating attention across different layers of the transformer. Our work contributes to the development of explainable AI for ViTs, which can help increase trust in AI applications by establishing more transparency regarding the inner workings of AI models. et.al.|[2312.14606](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14606)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**MonoLSS: Learnable Sample Selection For Monocular 3D Detection**|In the field of autonomous driving, monocular 3D detection is a critical task which estimates 3D properties (depth, dimension, and orientation) of objects in a single RGB image. Previous works have used features in a heuristic way to learn 3D properties, without considering that inappropriate features could have adverse effects. In this paper, sample selection is introduced that only suitable samples should be trained to regress the 3D properties. To select samples adaptively, we propose a Learnable Sample Selection (LSS) module, which is based on Gumbel-Softmax and a relative-distance sample divider. The LSS module works under a warm-up strategy leading to an improvement in training stability. Additionally, since the LSS module dedicated to 3D property sample selection relies on object-level features, we further develop a data augmentation method named MixUp3D to enrich 3D property samples which conforms to imaging principles without introducing ambiguity. As two orthogonal methods, the LSS module and MixUp3D can be utilized independently or in conjunction. Sufficient experiments have shown that their combined use can lead to synergistic effects, yielding improvements that transcend the mere sum of their individual applications. Leveraging the LSS module and the MixUp3D, without any extra data, our method named MonoLSS ranks 1st in all three categories (Car, Cyclist, and Pedestrian) on KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, and achieves competitive results on both the Waymo dataset and KITTI-nuScenes cross-dataset evaluation. The code is included in the supplementary material and will be released to facilitate related academic and industrial studies. et.al.|[2312.14474](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14474)|null|
|**2023-12-21**|**DriveLM: Driving with Graph Visual Question Answering**|We study how vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data can be integrated into end-to-end driving systems to boost generalization and enable interactivity with human users. While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations. We hope this work can be the starting point to shed new light on how to apply VLMs for autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, all code, data, and models are available to the public. et.al.|[2312.14150](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14150)|**[link](https://github.com/opendrivelab/drivelm)**|

Video question-answering (QA) in natural language provides the opportunity for bridging this gap. Nonetheless, evaluating the performance of Video QA models has proved particularly tough due to the absence of comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce LingoQA, a benchmark specifically for autonomous driving Video QA. The LingoQA trainable metric demonstrates a 0.95 Spearman correlation coefficient with human evaluations. We introduce a Video QA dataset of central London consisting of 419k samples that we release with the paper. We establish a baseline vision-language model and run extensive ablation studies to understand its performance. et.al.|[2312.14115](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14115)|**[link](https://github.com/wayveai/lingoqa)**|
|**2023-12-20**|**Building Lane-Level Maps from Aerial Images**|Detecting lane lines from sensors is becoming an increasingly significant part of autonomous driving systems. However, less development has been made on high-definition lane-level mapping based on aerial images, which could automatically build and update offline maps for auto-driving systems. To this end, our work focuses on extracting fine-level detailed lane lines together with their topological structures. This task is challenging since it requires large amounts of data covering different lane types, terrain and regions. In this paper, we introduce for the first time a large-scale aerial image dataset built for lane detection, with high-quality polyline lane annotations on high-resolution images of around 80 kilometers of road. Moreover, we developed a baseline deep learning lane detection method from aerial images, called AerialLaneNet, consisting of two stages. The first stage is to produce coarse-grained results at point level, and the second stage exploits the coarse-grained results and feature to perform the vertex-matching task, producing fine-grained lanes with topology. The experiments show our approach achieves significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset.

|**2023-12-20**|**AccidentGPT: Accident analysis and prevention from V2X Environmental Perception with Multi-modal Large Model**|Traffic accidents, being a significant contributor to both human casualties and property damage, have long been a focal point of research for many scholars in the field of traffic safety. However, previous studies, whether focusing on static environmental assessments or dynamic driving analyses, as well as pre-accident predictions or post-accident rule analyses, have typically been conducted in isolation. There has been a lack of an effective framework for developing a comprehensive understanding and application of traffic safety. To address this gap, this paper introduces AccidentGPT, a comprehensive accident analysis and prevention multi-modal large model. AccidentGPT establishes a multi-modal information interaction framework grounded in multi-sensor perception, thereby enabling a holistic approach to accident analysis and prevention in the field of traffic safety. Specifically, our capabilities can be categorized as follows: for autonomous driving vehicles, we provide comprehensive environmental perception and understanding to control the vehicle and avoid collisions. For human-driven vehicles, we offer proactive long-range safety warnings and blind-spot alerts while also providing safety driving recommendations and behavioral norms through human-machine dialogue and interaction. Additionally, for traffic police and management agencies, our framework supports intelligent and real-time analysis of traffic safety, encompassing pedestrian, vehicles, roads, and the environment through collaborative perception from multiple vehicles and road testing devices. The system is also capable of providing a thorough analysis of accident causes and liability after vehicle collisions. Our framework stands as the first large model to integrate comprehensive scene understanding into traffic safety studies. et.al.|[2312.13156](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13156)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Optimizing Ego Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: The Graph Enhancement Approach**|Predicting the trajectory of an ego vehicle is a critical component of autonomous driving systems. Current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and sequential models to process front-view images for future trajectory prediction. However, these approaches often struggle with perspective issues affecting object features in the scene. To address this, we advocate for the use of Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspectives, which offer unique advantages in capturing spatial relationships and object homogeneity. In our work, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and positional encoding to represent objects in a BEV, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional DNN-based methods. While the BEV-based approach loses some detailed information inherent to front-view images, we balance this by enriching the BEV data by representing it as a graph where relationships between the objects in a scene are captured effectively. et.al.|[2312.13104](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13104)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**PPEA-Depth: Progressive Parameter-Efficient Adaptation for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation**|Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is of significant importance with applications spanning across autonomous driving and robotics. However, the reliance on self-supervision introduces a strong static-scene assumption, thereby posing challenges in achieving optimal performance in dynamic scenes, which are prevalent in most real-world situations. To address these issues, we propose PPEA-Depth, a Progressive Parameter-Efficient Adaptation approach to transfer a pre-trained image model for self-supervised depth estimation. The training comprises two sequential stages: an initial phase trained on a dataset primarily composed of static scenes, succeeded by an expansion to more intricate datasets involving dynamic scenes. To facilitate this process, we design compact encoder and decoder adapters to enable parameter-efficient tuning, allowing the network to adapt effectively. They not only uphold generalized patterns from pre-trained image models but also retain knowledge gained from the preceding phase into the subsequent one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PPEA-Depth achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, CityScapes and DDAD datasets. et.al.|[2312.13066](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13066)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**TADAP: Trajectory-Aided Drivable area Auto-labeling with Pre-trained self-supervised features in winter driving conditions**|Detection of the drivable area in all conditions is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. However, the amount of labeled data in adverse driving conditions is limited, especially in winter, and supervised methods generalize poorly to conditions outside the training distribution. For easy adaption to all conditions, the need for human annotation should be removed from the learning process. In this paper, Trajectory-Aided Drivable area Auto-labeling with Pre-trained self-supervised features (TADAP) is presented for automated annotation of the drivable area in winter driving conditions. A sample of the drivable area is extracted based on the trajectory estimate from the global navigation satellite system. Similarity with the sample area is determined based on pre-trained self-supervised visual features. Image areas similar to the sample area are considered to be drivable. These TADAP labels were evaluated with a novel winter-driving dataset, collected in varying driving scenes. A prediction model trained with the TADAP labels achieved a +9.6 improvement in intersection over union compared to the previous state-of-the-art of self-supervised drivable area detection. et.al.|[2312.12954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12954)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**PointeNet: A Lightweight Framework for Effective and Efficient Point Cloud Analysis**|Current methodologies in point cloud analysis predominantly explore 3D geometries, often achieved through the introduction of intricate learnable geometric extractors in the encoder or by deepening networks with repeated blocks. However, these approaches inevitably lead to a significant number of learnable parameters, resulting in substantial computational costs and imposing memory burdens on CPU/GPU. Additionally, the existing strategies are primarily tailored for object-level point cloud classification and segmentation tasks, with limited extensions to crucial scene-level applications, such as autonomous driving. In response to these limitations, we introduce PointeNet, an efficient network designed specifically for point cloud analysis. PointeNet distinguishes itself with its lightweight architecture, low training cost, and plug-and-play capability, effectively capturing representative features. The network consists of a Multivariate Geometric Encoding (MGE) module and an optional Distance-aware Semantic Enhancement (DSE) module. The MGE module employs operations of sampling, grouping, and multivariate geometric aggregation to lightweightly capture and adaptively aggregate multivariate geometric features, providing a comprehensive depiction of 3D geometries. The DSE module, designed for real-world autonomous driving scenarios, enhances the semantic perception of point clouds, particularly for distant points. Our method demonstrates flexibility by seamlessly integrating with a classification/segmentation head or embedding into off-the-shelf 3D object detection networks, achieving notable performance improvements at a minimal cost. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets, including ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart, and the scene-level dataset KITTI, demonstrate the superior performance of PointeNet over state-of-the-art methods in point cloud analysis. et.al.|[2312.12743](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12743)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Studying the Practices of Testing Machine Learning Software in the Wild**|Background: We are witnessing an increasing adoption of machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL) algorithms in many software systems, including safety-critical systems such as health care systems or autonomous driving vehicles. Ensuring the software quality of these systems is yet an open challenge for the research community, mainly due to the inductive nature of ML software systems. Traditionally, software systems were constructed deductively, by writing down the rules that govern the behavior of the system as program code. However, for ML software, these rules are inferred from training data. Few recent research advances in the quality assurance of ML systems have adapted different concepts from traditional software testing, such as mutation testing, to help improve the reliability of ML software systems. However, it is unclear if any of these proposed testing techniques from research are adopted in practice. There is little empirical evidence about the testing strategies of ML engineers. Aims: To fill this gap, we perform the first fine-grained empirical study on ML testing practices in the wild, to identify the ML properties being tested, the followed testing strategies, and their implementation throughout the ML workflow. Method: First, we systematically summarized the different testing strategies (e.g., Oracle Approximation), the tested ML properties (e.g., Correctness, Bias, and Fairness), and the testing methods (e.g., Unit test) from the literature. Then, we conducted a study to understand the practices of testing ML software. Results: In our findings: 1) we identified four (4) major categories of testing strategy including Grey-box, White-box, Black-box, and Heuristic-based techniques that are used by the ML engineers to find software bugs. 2) We identified 16 ML properties that are tested in the ML workflow. et.al.|[2312.12604](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12604)|**[link](https://github.com/swatlab-git/tosem-2021-replication)**|

Its significance extends to applications like autonomous driving, where a clear understanding of heavily occluded objects is essential. However, modern detection and tracking algorithms often overlook this critical capability, perhaps due to the prevalence of modal annotations in most datasets. To address the scarcity of amodal data, we introduce the TAO-Amodal benchmark, featuring 880 diverse categories in thousands of video sequences. Our dataset includes amodal and modal bounding boxes for visible and occluded objects, including objects that are partially out-of-frame. To enhance amodal tracking with object permanence, we leverage a lightweight plug-in module, the amodal expander, to transform standard, modal trackers into amodal ones through fine-tuning on a few hundred video sequences with data augmentation. We achieve a 3.3\% and 1.6\% improvement on the detection and tracking of occluded objects on TAO-Amodal. When evaluated on people, our method produces dramatic improvements of 2x compared to state-of-the-art modal baselines. et.al.|[2312.12433](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12433)|**[link](https://github.com/WesleyHsieh0806/TAO-Amodal)**|

|**2023-12-19**|**M-BEV: Masked BEV Perception for Robust Autonomous Driving**|3D perception is a critical problem in autonomous driving. Recently, the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) approach has attracted extensive attention, due to low-cost deployment and desirable vision detection capacity. However, the existing models ignore a realistic scenario during the driving procedure, i.e., one or more view cameras may be failed, which largely deteriorates the performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a generic Masked BEV (M-BEV) perception framework, which can effectively improve robustness to this challenging scenario, by random masking and reconstructing camera views in the end-to-end training. More specifically, we develop a novel Masked View Reconstruction (MVR) module for M-BEV. It mimics various missing cases by randomly masking features of different camera views, then leverages the original features of these views as self-supervision, and reconstructs the masked ones with the distinct spatio-temporal context across views. Via such a plug-and-play MVR, our M-BEV is capable of learning the missing views from the resting ones, and thus well generalized for robust view recovery and accurate perception in the testing. We perform extensive experiments on the popular NuScenes benchmark, where our framework can significantly boost 3D perception performance of the state-of-the-art models on various missing view cases, e.g., for the absence of back view, our M-BEV promotes the PETRv2 model with 10.3% mAP gain. et.al.|[2312.12144](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12144)|**[link](https://github.com/sranc3/m-bev)**|
|**2023-12-19**|**Parameterized Decision-making with Multi-modal Perception for Autonomous Driving**|Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that has advanced rapidly over the last decade. Modern transportation is expected to benefit greatly from a wise decision-making framework of autonomous vehicles, including the improvement of mobility and the minimization of risks and travel time. However, existing methods either ignore the complexity of environments only fitting straight roads, or ignore the impact on surrounding vehicles during optimization phases, leading to weak environmental adaptability and incomplete optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose a parameterized decision-making framework with multi-modal perception based on deep reinforcement learning, called AUTO. We conduct a comprehensive perception to capture the state features of various traffic participants around the autonomous vehicle, based on which we design a graph-based model to learn a state representation of the multi-modal semantic features. To distinguish between lane-following and lane-changing, we decompose an action of the autonomous vehicle into a parameterized action structure that first decides whether to change lanes and then computes an exact action to execute. A hybrid reward function takes into account aspects of safety, traffic efficiency, passenger comfort, and impact to guide the framework to generate optimal actions. In addition, we design a regularization term and a multi-worker paradigm to enhance the training. Extensive experiments offer evidence that AUTO can advance state-of-the-art in terms of both macroscopic and microscopic effectiveness. et.al.|[2312.11935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11935)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Transformer Network for Multi-Person Tracking and Re-Identification in Unconstrained Environment**|Multi-object tracking (MOT) has profound applications in a variety of fields, including surveillance, sports analytics, self-driving, and cooperative robotics. Despite considerable advancements, existing MOT methodologies tend to falter when faced with non-uniform movements, occlusions, and appearance-reappearance scenarios of the objects. Recognizing this inadequacy, we put forward an integrated MOT method that not only marries object detection and identity linkage within a singular, end-to-end trainable framework but also equips the model with the ability to maintain object identity links over long periods of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is built around four key modules: 1) candidate proposal generation, which generates object proposals via a vision-transformer encoder-decoder architecture that detects the object from each frame in the video; 2) scale variant pyramid, a progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; 3) spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and 4) spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT lies in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with attention mechanisms and eradicates the need for post-processing. et.al.|[2312.11929](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11929)|null|
|**2023-12-19**|**Regulating Intermediate 3D Features for Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving**|Multi-camera perception tasks have gained significant attention in the field of autonomous driving. However, existing frameworks based on Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) in the multi-camera setting cannot produce suitable dense 3D features due to the projection nature and uncontrollable densification process. To resolve this problem, we propose to regulate intermediate dense 3D features with the help of volume rendering. Specifically, we employ volume rendering to process the dense 3D features to obtain corresponding 2D features (e.g., depth maps, semantic maps), which are supervised by associated labels in the training. This manner regulates the generation of dense 3D features on the feature level, providing appropriate dense and unified features for multiple perception tasks. Therefore, our approach is termed Vampire, stands for "Volume rendering As Multi-camera Perception Intermediate feature REgulator". Experimental results on the Occ3D and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Vampire facilitates fine-grained and appropriate extraction of dense 3D features, and is competitive with existing SOTA methods across diverse downstream perception tasks like 3D occupancy prediction, LiDAR segmentation and 3D objection detection, while utilizing moderate GPU resources.

However, CAV control presents significant challenges, given the complexity of interconnectivity and coordination required among the vehicles. To address this, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), with its notable advancements in addressing complex problems in autonomous driving, robotics, and human-vehicle interaction, has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing the capabilities of CAVs. However, there is a notable absence of current reviews on the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in the context of CAVs. Therefore, this paper delivers a comprehensive review of the application of MARL techniques within the field of CAV control. The paper begins by introducing MARL, followed by a detailed explanation of its unique advantages in addressing complex mobility and traffic scenarios that involve multiple agents. It then presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications on the extent of control dimensions for CAVs, covering critical and typical scenarios such as platooning control, lane-changing, and unsignalized intersections. In addition, the paper provides a comprehensive review of the prominent simulation platforms used to create reliable environments for training in MARL. Lastly, the paper examines the current challenges associated with deploying MARL within CAV control and outlines potential solutions that can effectively overcome these issues.

|**2023-12-18**|**Multi-Correlation Siamese Transformer Network with Dense Connection for 3D Single Object Tracking**|Point cloud-based 3D object tracking is an important task in autonomous driving. Though great advances regarding Siamese-based 3D tracking have been made recently, it remains challenging to learn the correlation between the template and search branches effectively with the sparse LIDAR point cloud data. Instead of performing correlation of the two branches at just one point in the network, in this paper, we present a multi-correlation Siamese Transformer network that has multiple stages and carries out feature correlation at the end of each stage based on sparse pillars. More specifically, in each stage, self-attention is first applied to each branch separately to capture the non-local context information. Then, cross-attention is used to inject the template information into the search area. This strategy allows the feature learning of the search area to be aware of the template while keeping the individual characteristics of the template intact. To enable the network to easily preserve the information learned at different stages and ease the optimization, for the search area, we densely connect the initial input sparse pillars and the output of each stage to all subsequent stages and the target localization network, which converts pillars to bird's eye view (BEV) feature maps and predicts the state of the target with a small densely connected convolution network. Deep supervision is added to each stage to further boost the performance as well. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the popular KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art. Ablation study that shows the effectiveness of each component is provided as well.

In this paper, we consider the problem of efficiently finding optimal and safe control for high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we propose to use dimensionality reduction techniques from a comparison theorem for stochastic differential equations together with a generalizable physics-informed neural network to estimate the optimal value function and the safety probability of the system. The proposed framework results in substantial sample efficiency improvement compared to existing methods.

|**2023-12-16**|**Improving Environment Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Autonomous Racing Using Bayesian Optimization-based Curriculum Learning**|Deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been broadly applied to a large number of robotics tasks, such as robot manipulation and autonomous driving. However, an open problem in deep RL is learning policies that are robust to variations in the environment, which is an important condition for such systems to be deployed into real-world, unstructured settings. Curriculum learning is one approach that has been applied to improve generalization performance in both supervised and reinforcement learning domains, but selecting the appropriate curriculum to achieve robustness can be a user-intensive process. In our work, we show that performing probabilistic inference of the underlying curriculum-reward function using Bayesian Optimization can be a promising technique for finding a robust curriculum. We demonstrate that a curriculum found with Bayesian optimization can outperform a vanilla deep RL agent and a hand-engineered curriculum in the domain of autonomous racing with obstacle avoidance.

In this work, we focus on the timeliness of computational-intensive updates, measured by Age-ofInformation (AoI), and study how to jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies for AoI with fractional form. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The uncertain edge load dynamics, the nature of the fractional objective, and hybrid continuous-discrete action space (due to the joint optimization) make this problem challenging and existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we propose a fractional reinforcement learning(RL) framework and prove its convergence. We further design a model-free fractional deep RL (DRL) algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 57.6% compared with several non-fractional benchmarks. et.al.|[2312.10418](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10418)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Constrained Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptable Safety Guarantee with Differentiable Convex Programming**|Despite remarkable achievements in artificial intelligence, the deployability of learning-enabled systems in high-stakes real-world environments still faces persistent challenges. For example, in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and healthcare, it is crucial not only to achieve high performance but also to comply with given constraints. Furthermore, adaptability becomes paramount in non-stationary domains, where environmental parameters are subject to change. While safety and adaptability are recognized as key qualities for the new generation of AI, current approaches have not demonstrated effective adaptable performance in constrained settings. Hence, this paper breaks new ground by studying the unique challenges of ensuring safety in non-stationary environments by solving constrained problems through the lens of the meta-learning approach (learning-to-learn). While unconstrained meta-learning al-ready encounters complexities in end-to-end differentiation of the loss due to the bi-level nature, its constrained counterpart introduces an additional layer of difficulty, since the constraints imposed on task-level updates complicate the differentiation process. To address the issue, we first employ successive convex-constrained policy updates across multiple tasks with differentiable convexprogramming, which allows meta-learning in constrained scenarios by enabling end-to-end differentiation. This approach empowers the agent to rapidly adapt to new tasks under non-stationarity while ensuring compliance with safety constraints. et.al.|[2312.10230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10230)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Communication-Efficient Soft Actor-Critic Policy Collaboration via Regulated Segment Mixture in Internet of Vehicles**|Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a foundational approach for addressing diverse, intelligent control tasks, notably in autonomous driving within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) domain. However, the widely assumed existence of a central node for centralized, federated learning-assisted MARL might be impractical in highly dynamic environments. This can lead to excessive communication overhead, potentially overwhelming the IoV system. To address these challenges, we design a novel communication-efficient and policy collaboration algorithm for MARL under the frameworks of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), named RSM-MASAC, within a fully distributed architecture. In particular, RSM-MASAC enhances multi-agent collaboration and prioritizes higher communication efficiency in dynamic IoV system by incorporating the concept of segmented aggregation in DFL and augmenting multiple model replicas from received neighboring policy segments, which are subsequently employed as reconstructed referential policies for mixing. Distinctively diverging from traditional RL approaches, with derived new bounds under Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MERL), RSM-MASAC adopts a theory-guided mixture metric to regulate the selection of contributive referential policies to guarantee the soft policy improvement during communication phase. Finally, the extensive simulations in mixed-autonomy traffic control scenarios verify the effectiveness and superiority of our algorithm. et.al.|[2312.10123](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10123)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Neurosymbolic Value-Inspired AI (Why, What, and How)**|The rapid progression of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, facilitated by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), has resulted in their widespread application to provide human assistance across diverse industries. This trend has sparked significant discourse centered around the ever-increasing need for LLM-based AI systems to function among humans as part of human society, sharing human values, especially as these systems are deployed in high-stakes settings (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, etc.). Towards this end, neurosymbolic AI systems are attractive due to their potential to enable easy-to-understand and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision-making, by leveraging explicit representations of shared values. In this paper, we introduce substantial extensions to Khaneman's System one/two framework and propose a neurosymbolic computational framework called Value-Inspired AI (VAI). It outlines the crucial components essential for the robust and practical implementation of VAI systems, aiming to represent and integrate various dimensions of human values.

|**2023-12-15**|**Structural Information Guided Multimodal Pre-training for Vehicle-centric Perception**|Understanding vehicles in images is important for various applications such as intelligent transportation and self-driving system. Existing vehicle-centric works typically pre-train models on large-scale classification datasets and then fine-tune them for specific downstream tasks. However, they neglect the specific characteristics of vehicle perception in different tasks and might thus lead to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel vehicle-centric pre-training framework called VehicleMAE, which incorporates the structural information including the spatial structure from vehicle profile information and the semantic structure from informative high-level natural language descriptions for effective masked vehicle appearance reconstruction. To be specific, we explicitly extract the sketch lines of vehicles as a form of the spatial structure to guide vehicle reconstruction. The more comprehensive knowledge distilled from the CLIP big model based on the similarity between the paired/unpaired vehicle image-text sample is further taken into consideration to help achieve a better understanding of vehicles. A large-scale dataset is built to pre-train our model, termed Autobot1M, which contains about 1M vehicle images and 12693 text information. Extensive experiments on four vehicle-based downstream tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our VehicleMAE.

|**2023-12-15**|**Embodied Adversarial Attack: A Dynamic Robust Physical Attack in Autonomous Driving**|As physical adversarial attacks become extensively applied in unearthing the potential risk of security-critical scenarios, especially in autonomous driving, their vulnerability to environmental changes has also been brought to light. The non-robust nature of physical adversarial attack methods brings less-than-stable performance consequently. To enhance the robustness of physical adversarial attacks in the real world, instead of statically optimizing a robust adversarial example via an off-line training manner like the existing methods, this paper proposes a brand new robust adversarial attack framework: Embodied Adversarial Attack (EAA) from the perspective of dynamic adaptation, which aims to employ the paradigm of embodied intelligence: Perception-Decision-Control to dynamically adjust the optimal attack strategy according to the current situations in real time. For the perception module, given the challenge of needing simulation for the victim's viewpoint, EAA innovatively devises a Perspective Transformation Network to estimate the target's transformation from the attacker's perspective. For the decision and control module, EAA adopts the laser-a highly manipulable medium to implement physical attacks, and further trains an attack agent with reinforcement learning to make it capable of instantaneously determining the best attack strategy based on the perceived information. Finally, we apply our framework to the autonomous driving scenario. A variety of experiments verify the high effectiveness of our method under complex scenes. et.al.|[2312.09554](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09554)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**DriveTrack: A Benchmark for Long-Range Point Tracking in Real-World Videos**|This paper presents DriveTrack, a new benchmark and data generation framework for long-range keypoint tracking in real-world videos. DriveTrack is motivated by the observation that the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers depends strongly on visual attributes around the selected keypoints, such as texture and lighting. The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in real-world videos, but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video, which is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases for point tracking in real-world videos. First, we show that fine-tuning keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to 7%. Second, we analyze the sensitivity of trackers to visual artifacts in real scenes and motivate the idea of running assistive keypoint selectors alongside trackers. et.al.|[2312.09523](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09523)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**SlowTrack: Increasing the Latency of Camera-based Perception in Autonomous Driving Using Adversarial Examples**|In Autonomous Driving (AD), real-time perception is a critical component responsible for detecting surrounding objects to ensure safe driving. While researchers have extensively explored the integrity of AD perception due to its safety and security implications, the aspect of availability (real-time performance) or latency has received limited attention. Existing works on latency-based attack have focused mainly on object detection, i.e., a component in camera-based AD perception, overlooking the entire camera-based AD perception, which hinders them to achieve effective system-level effects, such as vehicle crashes. In this paper, we propose SlowTrack, a novel framework for generating adversarial attacks to increase the execution time of camera-based AD perception. We propose a novel two-stage attack strategy along with the three new loss function designs. Our evaluation is conducted on four popular camera-based AD perception pipelines, and the results demonstrate that SlowTrack significantly outperforms existing latency-based attacks while maintaining comparable imperceptibility levels. Furthermore, we perform the evaluation on Baidu Apollo, an industry-grade full-stack AD system, and LGSVL, a production-grade AD simulator, with two scenarios to compare the system-level effects of SlowTrack and existing attacks. Our evaluation results show that the system-level effects can be significantly improved, i.e., the vehicle crash rate of SlowTrack is around 95% on average while existing works only have around 30%. et.al.|[2312.09520](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09520)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**EDA: Evolving and Distinct Anchors for Multimodal Motion Prediction**|Motion prediction is a crucial task in autonomous driving, and one of its major challenges lands in the multimodality of future behaviors. Many successful works have utilized mixture models which require identification of positive mixture components, and correspondingly fall into two main lines: prediction-based and anchor-based matching. The prediction clustering phenomenon in prediction-based matching makes it difficult to pick representative trajectories for downstream tasks, while the anchor-based matching suffers from a limited regression capability. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm, named Evolving and Distinct Anchors (EDA), to define the positive and negative components for multimodal motion prediction based on mixture models. We enable anchors to evolve and redistribute themselves under specific scenes for an enlarged regression capacity. Furthermore, we select distinct anchors before matching them with the ground truth, which results in impressive scoring performance. Our approach enhances all metrics compared to the baseline MTR, particularly with a notable relative reduction of 13.5% in Miss Rate, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

However, accurately understanding humans' commands, particularly for autonomous vehicles that have only passengers instead of drivers, and achieving a high level of personalization remain challenging tasks in the development of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework Talk-to-Drive (Talk2Drive) to process verbal commands from humans and make autonomous driving decisions with contextual information, satisfying their personalized preferences for safety, efficiency, and comfort. First, a speech recognition module is developed for Talk2Drive to interpret verbal inputs from humans to textual instructions, which are then sent to LLMs for reasoning. Then, appropriate commands for the Electrical Control Unit (ECU) are generated, achieving a 100\% success rate in executing codes. Real-world experiments show that our framework can substantially reduce the takeover rate for a diverse range of drivers by up to 90.1\%. To the best of our knowledge, Talk2Drive marks the first instance of employing an LLM-based system in a real-world autonomous driving environment. et.al.|[2312.09397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09397)|null|

In this work, we delve into the potential of large language models (LLMs) in autonomous driving (AD). We introduce DriveMLM, an LLM-based AD framework that can perform close-loop autonomous driving in realistic simulators. To this end, (1) we bridge the gap between the language decisions and the vehicle control commands by standardizing the decision states according to the off-the-shelf motion planning module. (2) We employ a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) to model the behavior planning module of a module AD system, which uses driving rules, user commands, and inputs from various sensors (e.g., camera, lidar) as input and makes driving decisions and provide explanations; This model can plug-and-play in existing AD systems such as Apollo for close-loop driving. (3) We design an effective data engine to collect a dataset that includes decision state and corresponding explanation annotation for model training and evaluation. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our model achieves 76.1 driving score on the CARLA Town05 Long, and surpasses the Apollo baseline by 4.7 points under the same settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.

It provides detailed information for autonomous driving planning and navigation. However, most existing methods heavily rely on the LiDAR point clouds to generate occupancy ground truth, which is not available in the vision-based system. In this paper, we propose an OccNeRF method for self-supervised multi-camera occupancy prediction. Different from bounded 3D occupancy labels, we need to consider unbounded scenes with raw image supervision. To solve the issue, we parameterize the reconstructed occupancy fields and reorganize the sampling strategy. The neural rendering is adopted to convert occupancy fields to multi-camera depth maps, supervised by multi-frame photometric consistency. Moreover, for semantic occupancy prediction, we design several strategies to polish the prompts and filter the outputs of a pretrained open-vocabulary 2D segmentation model.

However, training a high-performance model in a fully-supervised manner always requires substantial amounts of manually annotated data, which can be both expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, our study explores the potential of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for class-agnostic motion prediction. Our SSL framework adopts a consistency-based self-training paradigm, enabling the model to learn from unlabeled data by generating pseudo labels through test-time inference. To improve the quality of pseudo labels, we propose a novel motion selection and re-generation module. This module effectively selects reliable pseudo labels and re-generates unreliable ones. Furthermore, we propose two data augmentation strategies: temporal sampling and BEVMix. These strategies facilitate consistency regularization in SSL. Experiments conducted on nuScenes demonstrate that our SSL method can surpass the self-supervised approach by a large margin by utilizing only a tiny fraction of labeled data. Furthermore, our method exhibits comparable performance to weakly and some fully supervised methods. These results highlight the ability of our method to strike a favorable balance between annotation costs and performance.

Under such a paradigm, accurate BEV representation construction relies on reliable depth estimation for multi-camera images. However, existing approaches exhaustively predict depths for every pixel without prioritizing objects, which are precisely the entities requiring detection in the 3D space. To this end, we propose IA-BEV, which integrates image-plane instance awareness into the depth estimation process within a BEV-based detector. First, a category-specific structural priors mining approach is proposed for enhancing the efficacy of monocular depth generation. Besides, a self-boosting learning strategy is further proposed to encourage the model to place more emphasis on challenging objects in computation-expensive temporal stereo matching. Together they provide advanced depth estimation results for high-quality BEV features construction, benefiting the ultimate 3D detection.

In this thesis, we present a series of frameworks for dynamic scene understanding starting from road event detection from an autonomous driving perspective to complex video activity detection, followed by continual learning approaches for the life-long learning of the models. Firstly, we introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset (ROAD) for Autonomous Driving, to our knowledge the first of its kind. Due to the lack of datasets equipped with formally specified logical requirements, we also introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset with logical Requirements (ROAD-R), the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving with requirements expressed as logical constraints, as a tool for driving neurosymbolic research in the area. Next, we extend event detection to holistic scene understanding by proposing two complex activity detection methods. In the first method, we present a deformable, spatiotemporal scene graph approach, consisting of three main building blocks: action tube detection, a 3D deformable RoI pooling layer designed for learning the flexible, deformable geometry of the constituent action tubes, and a scene graph constructed by considering all parts as nodes and connecting them based on different semantics. In a second approach evolving from the first, we propose a hybrid graph neural network that combines attention applied to a graph encoding of the local (short-term) dynamic scene with a temporal graph modelling the overall long-duration activity.

On the one hand, large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach "Artificial General Intelligence". On the other hand, previous autonomous driving methods tend to rely on limited-format inputs (e.g. sensor data and navigation waypoints), restricting the vehicle's ability to understand language information and interact with humans.

Indeed, a well-balanced trade-off between performance and energy consumption is crucial for the sustainability of autonomous vehicles. In this context, the diversity of real-world contexts in which autonomous vehicles can operate motivates the need for empowering perception models with the capability to detect, characterize and identify newly appearing objects by themselves.

A Preliminary Investigation**|In machine learning, generalization against distribution shifts -- where deployment conditions diverge from the training scenarios -- is crucial, particularly in fields like climate modeling, biomedicine, and autonomous driving. The emergence of foundation models, distinguished by their extensive pretraining and task versatility, has led to an increased interest in their adaptability to distribution shifts. GPT-4V(ision) acts as the most advanced publicly accessible multimodal foundation model, with extensive applications across various domains, including anomaly detection, video understanding, image generation, and medical diagnosis.

Therefore, they can benefit from a successful implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, improving safety, reducing labor costs and fuel consumption, and increasing operational efficiency. The main contribution of this paper is the experimental validation of a path tracking control strategy, composed of longitudinal and lateral controllers, on an off-road scenario with a fully-loaded heavy-duty truck. The longitudinal control strategy relies on a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC), which considers the path geometry and simplified vehicle dynamics to compute a smooth and comfortable input velocity, without violating the imposed constraints. The lateral controller is based on a Robust Linear Quadratic Regulator (RLQR), which considers a vehicle model subject to parametric uncertainties to minimize its lateral displacement and heading error, as well as ensure stability. Experiments were carried out using a fully-loaded vehicle on unpaved roads in an open-pit mine.

|**2023-12-14**|**MWSIS: Multimodal Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation with 2D Box Annotations for Autonomous Driving**|Instance segmentation is a fundamental research in computer vision, especially in autonomous driving. However, manual mask annotation for instance segmentation is quite time-consuming and costly. To address this problem, some prior works attempt to apply weakly supervised manner by exploring 2D or 3D boxes. However, no one has ever successfully segmented 2D and 3D instances simultaneously by only using 2D box annotations, which could further reduce the annotation cost by an order of magnitude. Thus, we propose a novel framework called Multimodal Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation (MWSIS), which incorporates various fine-grained label generation and correction modules for both 2D and 3D modalities to improve the quality of pseudo labels, along with a new multimodal cross-supervision approach, named Consistency Sparse Cross-modal Supervision (CSCS), to reduce the inconsistency of multimodal predictions by response distillation. Particularly, transferring the 3D backbone to downstream tasks not only improves the performance of the 3D detectors, but also outperforms fully supervised instance segmentation with only 5% fully supervised annotations. On the Waymo dataset, the proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline, especially achieving 2.59% mAP and 12.75% mAP increases for 2D and 3D instance segmentation tasks, respectively.

By enabling vehicle-to-vehicle communication, these systems expand the vehicles environmental awareness, allowing them to detect hidden obstacles and thereby enhancing safety and reducing crash rates compared to human drivers who rely solely on visual perception. A key application of this technology is vehicle platooning, where connected vehicles drive in a coordinated formation. This paper introduces a vehicle platooning approach designed to enhance traffic flow and safety. Developed using deep reinforcement learning in the Unity 3D game engine, known for its advanced physics, this approach aims for a high-fidelity physical simulation that closely mirrors real-world conditions. The proposed platooning model focuses on scalability, decentralization, and fostering positive cooperation through the introduced predecessor-follower "sharing and caring" communication framework. The study demonstrates how these elements collectively enhance autonomous driving performance and robustness, both for individual vehicles and for the platoon as a whole, in an urban setting. This results in improved road safety and reduced traffic congestion. et.al.|[2312.06858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06858)|null|

|**2024-05-02**|**Plan-Seq-Learn: Language Model Guided RL for Solving Long Horizon Robotics Tasks**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of performing high-level planning for long-horizon robotics tasks, yet existing methods require access to a pre-defined skill library (e.g. picking, placing, pulling, pushing, navigating). However, LLM planning does not address how to design or learn those behaviors, which remains challenging particularly in long-horizon settings. Furthermore, for many tasks of interest, the robot needs to be able to adjust its behavior in a fine-grained manner, requiring the agent to be capable of modifying low-level control actions. Can we instead use the internet-scale knowledge from LLMs for high-level policies, guiding reinforcement learning (RL) policies to efficiently solve robotic control tasks online without requiring a pre-determined set of skills? In this paper, we propose Plan-Seq-Learn (PSL): a modular approach that uses motion planning to bridge the gap between abstract language and learned low-level control for solving long-horizon robotics tasks from scratch. We demonstrate that PSL achieves state-of-the-art results on over 25 challenging robotics tasks with up to 10 stages. PSL solves long-horizon tasks from raw visual input spanning four benchmarks at success rates of over 85%, out-performing language-based, classical, and end-to-end approaches.

|**2024-05-02**|**OmniDrive: A Holistic LLM-Agent Framework for Autonomous Driving with 3D Perception, Reasoning and Planning**|The advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to growing interests in LLM-based autonomous driving agents to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, capitalizing on MLLMs' strong reasoning capabilities for improved planning behavior is challenging since planning requires full 3D situational awareness beyond 2D reasoning. To address this challenge, our work proposes a holistic framework for strong alignment between agent models and 3D driving tasks. Our framework starts with a novel 3D MLLM architecture that uses sparse queries to lift and compress visual representations into 3D before feeding them into an LLM. This query-based representation allows us to jointly encode dynamic objects and static map elements (e.g., traffic lanes), providing a condensed world model for perception-action alignment in 3D. We further propose OmniDrive-nuScenes, a new visual question-answering dataset challenging the true 3D situational awareness of a model with comprehensive visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, including scene description, traffic regulation, 3D grounding, counterfactual reasoning, decision making and planning. Extensive studies show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture as well as the importance of the VQA tasks for reasoning and planning in complex 3D scenes. et.al.|[2405.01533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01533)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**FLAME: Factuality-Aware Alignment for Large Language Models**|Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability. et.al.|[2405.01525](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01525)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Transformer-Aided Semantic Communications**|The transformer structure employed in large language models (LLMs), as a specialized category of deep neural networks (DNNs) featuring attention mechanisms, stands out for their ability to identify and highlight the most relevant aspects of input data. Such a capability is particularly beneficial in addressing a variety of communication challenges, notably in the realm of semantic communication where proper encoding of the relevant data is critical especially in systems with limited bandwidth. In this work, we employ vision transformers specifically for the purpose of compression and compact representation of the input image, with the goal of preserving semantic information throughout the transmission process. Through the use of the attention mechanism inherent in transformers, we create an attention mask. This mask effectively prioritizes critical segments of images for transmission, ensuring that the reconstruction phase focuses on key objects highlighted by the mask. Our methodology significantly improves the quality of semantic communication and optimizes bandwidth usage by encoding different parts of the data in accordance with their semantic information content, thus enhancing overall efficiency. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, focusing on both reconstruction quality and accuracy. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our framework successfully preserves semantic information, even when only a fraction of the encoded data is transmitted, according to the intended compression rates. et.al.|[2405.01521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01521)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Analyzing the Role of Semantic Representations in the Era of Large Language Models**|Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs? Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments. We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction. We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm. et.al.|[2405.01502](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01502)|**[link](https://github.com/causalnlp/amr_llm)**|
|**2024-05-02**|**Supporting Business Document Workflows via Collection-Centric Information Foraging with Large Language Models**|Knowledge workers often need to extract and analyze information from a collection of documents to solve complex information tasks in the workplace, e.g., hiring managers reviewing resumes or analysts assessing risk in contracts. However, foraging for relevant information can become tedious and repetitive over many documents and criteria of interest. We introduce Marco, a mixed-initiative workspace supporting sensemaking over diverse business document collections. Through collection-centric assistance, Marco reduces the cognitive costs of extracting and structuring information, allowing users to prioritize comparative synthesis and decision making processes. Users interactively communicate their information needs to an AI assistant using natural language and compose schemas that provide an overview of a document collection. Findings from a usability study (n=16) demonstrate that when using Marco, users complete sensemaking tasks 16% more quickly, with less effort, and without diminishing accuracy. A design probe with seven domain experts identifies how Marco can benefit various real-world workflows. et.al.|[2405.01501](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01501)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Controllable Text Generation in the Instruction-Tuning Era**|While most research on controllable text generation has focused on steering base Language Models, the emerging instruction-tuning and prompting paradigm offers an alternate approach to controllability. We compile and release ConGenBench, a testbed of 17 different controllable generation tasks, using a subset of it to benchmark the performance of 9 different baselines and methods on Instruction-tuned Language Models. To our surprise, we find that prompting-based approaches outperform controllable text generation methods on most datasets and tasks, highlighting a need for research on controllable text generation with Instruction-tuned Language Models in specific. Prompt-based approaches match human performance on most stylistic tasks while lagging on structural tasks, foregrounding a need to study more varied constraints and more challenging stylistic tasks. To facilitate such research, we provide an algorithm that uses only a task dataset and a Large Language Model with in-context capabilities to automatically generate a constraint dataset. This method eliminates the fields dependence on pre-curated constraint datasets, hence vastly expanding the range of constraints that can be studied in the future. et.al.|[2405.01490](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01490)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**NeMo-Aligner: Scalable Toolkit for Efficient Model Alignment**|Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and preferences is essential for making them helpful and safe. However, building efficient tools to perform alignment can be challenging, especially for the largest and most competent LLMs which often contain tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We create NeMo-Aligner, a toolkit for model alignment that can efficiently scale to using hundreds of GPUs for training. NeMo-Aligner comes with highly optimized and scalable implementations for major paradigms of model alignment such as: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SteerLM, and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN). Additionally, our toolkit supports running most of the alignment techniques in a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) setting. NeMo-Aligner is designed for extensibility, allowing support for other alignment techniques with minimal effort. It is open-sourced with Apache 2.0 License and we invite community contributions at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner et.al.|[2405.01481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01481)|**[link](https://github.com/nvidia/nemo-aligner)**|
|**2024-05-02**|**A Systematic Literature Review on Large Language Models for Automated Program Repair**|Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to patch software bugs and reduce manual debugging efforts. Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2024. We analyze 127 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline three types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research. et.al.|[2405.01466](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01466)|null|
|**2024-05-02**|**Natural Language to Verilog: Design of a Recurrent Spiking Neural Network using Large Language Models and ChatGPT**|This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the generation of hardware description code, aiming to explore their potential in supporting and enhancing the development of efficient neuromorphic computing architectures. Building on our prior work, we employ OpenAI's ChatGPT4 and natural language prompts to synthesize a RTL Verilog module of a programmable recurrent spiking neural network, while also generating test benches to assess the system's correctness. The resultant design was validated in three case studies, the exclusive OR,the IRIS flower classification and the MNIST hand-written digit classification, achieving accuracies of up to 96.6%. To verify its synthesizability and implementability, the design was prototyped on a field-programmable gate array and implemented on SkyWater 130 nm technology by using an open-source electronic design automation flow. Additionally, we have submitted it to Tiny Tapeout 6 chip fabrication program to further evaluate the system on-chip performance in the future. et.al.|[2405.01419](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01419)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Is Bigger Edit Batch Size Always Better? -- An Empirical Study on Model Editing with Llama-3**|This study presents a targeted model editing analysis focused on the latest large language model, Llama-3. We explore the efficacy of popular model editing techniques - ROME, MEMIT, and EMMET, which are designed for precise layer interventions. We identify the most effective layers for targeted edits through an evaluation that encompasses up to 4096 edits across three distinct strategies: sequential editing, batch editing, and a hybrid approach we call as sequential-batch editing. Our findings indicate that increasing edit batch-sizes may degrade model performance more significantly than using smaller edit batches sequentially for equal number of edits. With this, we argue that sequential model editing is an important component for scaling model editing methods and future research should focus on methods that combine both batched and sequential editing. This observation suggests a potential limitation in current model editing methods which push towards bigger edit batch sizes, and we hope it paves way for future investigations into optimizing batch sizes and model editing performance. et.al.|[2405.00664](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00664)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**HalluVault: A Novel Logic Programming-aided Metamorphic Testing Framework for Detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations in Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts. Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH). Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms. Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%. Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations. These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations. et.al.|[2405.00648](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00648)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**When Quantization Affects Confidence of Large Language Models?**|Recent studies introduced effective compression techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) via post-training quantization or low-bit weight representation. Although quantized weights offer storage efficiency and allow for faster inference, existing works have indicated that quantization might compromise performance and exacerbate biases in LLMs. This study investigates the confidence and calibration of quantized models, considering factors such as language model type and scale as contributors to quantization loss. Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales. Finally, we propose an explanation for quantization loss based on confidence levels, indicating that quantization disproportionately affects samples where the full model exhibited low confidence levels in the first place. et.al.|[2405.00632](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00632)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**"I'm Not Sure, But...": Examining the Impact of Large Language Models' Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust**|Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale. et.al.|[2405.00623](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00623)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Addressing Topic Granularity and Hallucination in Large Language Models for Topic Modelling**|Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches. As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents. However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics. Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics. et.al.|[2405.00611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00611)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Investigating Automatic Scoring and Feedback using Large Language Models**|Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models. With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation. Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks. To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning. This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback. We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks. The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average. For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback. The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency. et.al.|[2405.00602](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00602)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**Are Models Biased on Text without Gender-related Language?**|Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions. A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data. In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings? To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation. Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models. Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation. We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval. et.al.|[2405.00588](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00588)|**[link](https://github.com/ucinlp/unstereo-eval)**|
|**2024-05-01**|**The Real, the Better: Aligning Large Language Models with Online Human Behaviors**|Large language model alignment is widely used and studied to avoid LLM producing unhelpful and harmful responses. However, the lengthy training process and predefined preference bias hinder adaptation to online diverse human preferences. To this end, this paper proposes an alignment framework, called Reinforcement Learning with Human Behavior (RLHB), to align LLMs by directly leveraging real online human behaviors. By taking the generative adversarial framework, the generator is trained to respond following expected human behavior; while the discriminator tries to verify whether the triplets of query, response, and human behavior come from real online environments. Behavior modeling in natural-language form and the multi-model joint training mechanism enable an active and sustainable online alignment. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods by both human and automatic evaluations. et.al.|[2405.00578](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00578)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**EALD-MLLM: Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos with Multi-modal Large Language Model**|Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states. Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video. However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden. In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram). However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews. In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player. NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state. Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis. EALD will be available on the open-source platform. et.al.|[2405.00574](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00574)|null|
|**2024-05-01**|**NumLLM: Numeric-Sensitive Large Language Model for Chinese Finance**|Recently, many works have proposed various financial large language models (FinLLMs) by pre-training from scratch or fine-tuning open-sourced LLMs on financial corpora. However, existing FinLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory performance in understanding financial text when numeric variables are involved in questions. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM, called numeric-sensitive large language model (NumLLM), for Chinese finance. We first construct a financial corpus from financial textbooks which is essential for improving numeric capability of LLMs during fine-tuning. After that, we train two individual low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules by fine-tuning on our constructed financial corpus. One module is for adapting general-purpose LLMs to financial domain, and the other module is for enhancing the ability of NumLLM to understand financial text with numeric variables. Lastly, we merge the two LoRA modules into the foundation model to obtain NumLLM for inference. Experiments on financial question-answering benchmark show that NumLLM can boost the performance of the foundation model and can achieve the best overall performance compared to all baselines, on both numeric and non-numeric questions. et.al.|[2405.00566](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00566)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Visual Fact Checker: Enabling High-Fidelity Detailed Caption Generation**|Existing automatic captioning methods for visual content face challenges such as lack of detail, content hallucination, and poor instruction following. In this work, we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC), a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects. VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal, where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification, where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning, where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results. In this step, VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions. We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption. 3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset. Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline, we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V, despite being over 10x smaller in model size. et.al.|[2404.19752](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19752)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**PrivComp-KG : Leveraging Knowledge Graph and Large Language Models for Privacy Policy Compliance Verification**|Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era. Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations. We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations. et.al.|[2404.19744](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19744)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Better & Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction**|Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes. et.al.|[2404.19737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19737)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**A Framework for Leveraging Human Computation Gaming to Enhance Knowledge Graphs for Accuracy Critical Generative AI Applications**|External knowledge graphs (KGs) can be used to augment large language models (LLMs), while simultaneously providing an explainable knowledge base of facts that can be inspected by a human. This approach may be particularly valuable in domains where explainability is critical, like human trafficking data analysis. However, creating KGs can pose challenges. KGs parsed from documents may comprise explicit connections (those directly stated by a document) but miss implicit connections (those obvious to a human although not directly stated). To address these challenges, this preliminary research introduces the GAME-KG framework, standing for "Gaming for Augmenting Metadata and Enhancing Knowledge Graphs." GAME-KG is a federated approach to modifying explicit as well as implicit connections in KGs by using crowdsourced feedback collected through video games. GAME-KG is shown through two demonstrations: a Unity test scenario from Dark Shadows, a video game that collects feedback on KGs parsed from US Department of Justice (DOJ) Press Releases on human trafficking, and a following experiment where OpenAI's GPT-4 is prompted to answer questions based on a modified and unmodified KG. Initial results suggest that GAME-KG can be an effective framework for enhancing KGs, while simultaneously providing an explainable set of structured facts verified by humans. et.al.|[2404.19729](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19729)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**PANGeA: Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI for Turn-Based Video Games**|This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs). Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative. The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses. PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative. A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative. Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative. For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs. PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game. These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo. As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input. et.al.|[2404.19721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19721)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Assessing LLMs in Malicious Code Deobfuscation of Real-world Malware Campaigns**|The integration of large language models (LLMs) into various pipelines is increasingly widespread, effectively automating many manual tasks and often surpassing human capabilities. Cybersecurity researchers and practitioners have recognised this potential. Thus, they are actively exploring its applications, given the vast volume of heterogeneous data that requires processing to identify anomalies, potential bypasses, attacks, and fraudulent incidents. On top of this, LLMs' advanced capabilities in generating functional code, comprehending code context, and summarising its operations can also be leveraged for reverse engineering and malware deobfuscation. To this end, we delve into the deobfuscation capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond merely discussing a hypothetical scenario, we evaluate four LLMs with real-world malicious scripts used in the notorious Emotet malware campaign. Our results indicate that while not absolutely accurate yet, some LLMs can efficiently deobfuscate such payloads. Thus, fine-tuning LLMs for this task can be a viable potential for future AI-powered threat intelligence pipelines in the fight against obfuscated malware. et.al.|[2404.19715](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19715)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Automated Generation of High-Quality Medical Simulation Scenarios Through Integration of Semi-Structured Data and Large Language Models**|This study introduces a transformative framework for medical education by integrating semi-structured data with Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily OpenAIs ChatGPT3.5, to automate the creation of medical simulation scenarios. Traditionally, developing these scenarios was a time-intensive process with limited flexibility to meet diverse educational needs. The proposed approach utilizes AI to efficiently generate detailed, clinically relevant scenarios that are tailored to specific educational objectives. This innovation has significantly reduced the time and resources required for scenario development, allowing for a broader variety of simulations. Preliminary feedback from educators and learners has shown enhanced engagement and improved knowledge acquisition, confirming the effectiveness of this AI-enhanced methodology in simulation-based learning. The integration of structured data with LLMs not only streamlines the creation process but also offers a scalable, dynamic solution that could revolutionize medical training, highlighting the critical role of AI in advancing educational outcomes and patient care standards. et.al.|[2404.19713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19713)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**When to Retrieve: Teaching LLMs to Utilize Information Retrieval Effectively**|In this paper, we demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively learn to use an off-the-shelf information retrieval (IR) system specifically when additional context is required to answer a given question. Given the performance of IR systems, the optimal strategy for question answering does not always entail external information retrieval; rather, it often involves leveraging the parametric memory of the LLM itself. Prior research has identified this phenomenon in the PopQA dataset, wherein the most popular questions are effectively addressed using the LLM's parametric memory, while less popular ones require IR system usage. Following this, we propose a tailored training approach for LLMs, leveraging existing open-domain question answering datasets. Here, LLMs are trained to generate a special token, <RET>, when they do not know the answer to a question. Our evaluation of the Adaptive Retrieval LLM (Adapt-LLM) on the PopQA dataset showcases improvements over the same LLM under three configurations: (i) retrieving information for all the questions, (ii) using always the parametric memory of the LLM, and (iii) using a popularity threshold to decide when to use a retriever. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that Adapt-LLM is able to generate the <RET> token when it determines that it does not know how to answer a question, indicating the need for IR, while it achieves notably high accuracy levels when it chooses to rely only on its parametric memory. et.al.|[2404.19705](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19705)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**Naturally Supervised 3D Visual Grounding with Language-Regularized Concept Learners**|3D visual grounding is a challenging task that often requires direct and dense supervision, notably the semantic label for each object in the scene. In this paper, we instead study the naturally supervised setting that learns from only 3D scene and QA pairs, where prior works underperform. We propose the Language-Regularized Concept Learner (LARC), which uses constraints from language as regularization to significantly improve the accuracy of neuro-symbolic concept learners in the naturally supervised setting. Our approach is based on two core insights: the first is that language constraints (e.g., a word's relation to another) can serve as effective regularization for structured representations in neuro-symbolic models; the second is that we can query large language models to distill such constraints from language properties. We show that LARC improves performance of prior works in naturally supervised 3D visual grounding, and demonstrates a wide range of 3D visual reasoning capabilities-from zero-shot composition, to data efficiency and transferability. Our method represents a promising step towards regularizing structured visual reasoning frameworks with language-based priors, for learning in settings without dense supervision. et.al.|[2404.19696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19696)|null|
|**2024-04-30**|**On Training a Neural Network to Explain Binaries**|In this work, we begin to investigate the possibility of training a deep neural network on the task of binary code understanding. Specifically, the network would take, as input, features derived directly from binaries and output English descriptions of functionality to aid a reverse engineer in investigating the capabilities of a piece of closed-source software, be it malicious or benign. Given recent success in applying large language models (generative AI) to the task of source code summarization, this seems a promising direction. However, in our initial survey of the available datasets, we found nothing of sufficiently high quality and volume to train these complex models. Instead, we build our own dataset derived from a capture of Stack Overflow containing 1.1M entries. A major result of our work is a novel dataset evaluation method using the correlation between two distances on sample pairs: one distance in the embedding space of inputs and the other in the embedding space of outputs. Intuitively, if two samples have inputs close in the input embedding space, their outputs should also be close in the output embedding space. We found this Embedding Distance Correlation (EDC) test to be highly diagnostic, indicating that our collected dataset and several existing open-source datasets are of low quality as the distances are not well correlated. We proceed to explore the general applicability of EDC, applying it to a number of qualitatively known good datasets and a number of synthetically known bad ones and found it to be a reliable indicator of dataset value. et.al.|[2404.19631](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19631)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Hallucination of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey**|This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), also known as Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which have demonstrated significant advancements and remarkable abilities in multimodal tasks. Despite these promising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with the visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial obstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their reliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing attention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We review recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these hallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes, evaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating open questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By drawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes, evaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the understanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in the field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs, providing valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners alike.

|**2024-04-29**|**DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF**|In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models (LLMs), its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal, as widely reported by numerous research studies. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights that demonstrate the superiority of our MDP framework over the previous sentence-level bandit formulation. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm, dubbed as Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive real-world alignment experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. et.al.|[2404.18922](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**TheaterGen: Character Management with LLM for Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation**|Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text. However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns. To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation. Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal". Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance". With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images. Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions. Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance. Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity. et.al.|[2404.18919](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18919)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Kangaroo: Lossless Self-Speculative Decoding via Double Early Exiting**|Speculative decoding has demonstrated its effectiveness in accelerating the inference of large language models while maintaining a consistent sampling distribution. However, the conventional approach of training a separate draft model to achieve a satisfactory token acceptance rate can be costly. Drawing inspiration from early exiting, we propose a novel self-speculative decoding framework \emph{Kangaroo}, which uses a fixed shallow sub-network as a self-draft model, with the remaining layers serving as the larger target model. We train a lightweight and efficient adapter module on top of the sub-network to bridge the gap between the sub-network and the full model's representation ability. It is noteworthy that the inference latency of the self-draft model may no longer be negligible compared to the large model, necessitating strategies to increase the token acceptance rate while minimizing the drafting steps of the small model. To address this challenge, we introduce an additional early exiting mechanism for generating draft tokens. Specifically, we halt the small model's subsequent prediction during the drafting phase once the confidence level for the current token falls below a certain threshold. Extensive experiments on the Spec-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of Kangaroo. Under single-sequence verification, Kangaroo achieves speedups up to $1.68\times$ on Spec-Bench, outperforming Medusa-1 with 88.7\% fewer additional parameters (67M compared to 591M).

|**2024-04-29**|**Human-in-the-Loop Synthetic Text Data Inspection with Provenance Tracking**|Data augmentation techniques apply transformations to existing texts to generate additional data. The transformations may produce low-quality texts, where the meaning of the text is changed and the text may even be mangled beyond human comprehension. Analyzing the synthetically generated texts and their corresponding labels is slow and demanding. To winnow out texts with incorrect labels, we develop INSPECTOR, a human-in-the-loop data inspection technique. INSPECTOR combines the strengths of provenance tracking techniques with assistive labeling. INSPECTOR allows users to group related texts by their transformation provenance, i.e., the transformations applied to the original text, or feature provenance, the linguistic features of the original text. For assistive labeling, INSPECTOR computes metrics that approximate data quality, and allows users to compare the corresponding label of each text against the predictions of a large language model. In a user study, INSPECTOR increases the number of texts with correct labels identified by 3X on a sentiment analysis task and by 4X on a hate speech detection task. The participants found grouping the synthetically generated texts by their common transformation to be the most useful technique. Surprisingly, grouping texts by common linguistic features was perceived to be unhelpful. Contrary to prior work, our study finds that no single technique obviates the need for human inspection effort. This validates the design of INSPECTOR which combines both analysis of data provenance and assistive labeling to reduce human inspection effort. et.al.|[2404.18881](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18881)|**[link](https://github.com/ucla-seal/provenanceinspector)**|
|**2024-04-29**|**More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Human Preference Alignment On Language Model Trustworthiness**|The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) development has led to improved performance on cognitive tasks as well as an urgent need to align these models with human values in order to safely exploit their power. Despite the effectiveness of preference learning algorithms like Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning human preferences, their assumed improvements on model trustworthiness haven't been thoroughly testified. Toward this end, this study investigates how models that have been aligned with general-purpose preference data on helpfulness and harmlessness perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. For model alignment, we focus on three widely used RLHF variants: Supervised Finetuning (SFT), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Through extensive empirical investigations, we discover that the improvement in trustworthiness by RLHF is far from guaranteed, and there exists a complex interplay between preference data, alignment algorithms, and specific trustworthiness aspects. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment. By shedding light on the intricate dynamics of these components within model alignment, we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are both capable and trustworthy. et.al.|[2404.18870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18870)|**[link](https://github.com/aaron-jx-li/rlhf-trustworthiness)**|
|**2024-04-29**|**Truth-value judgment in language models: belief directions are context sensitive**|Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as getting at a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions can be described as being conditional on the preceding (related) sentences. Specifically, we quantify the responsiveness of the probes to the presence of (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences, and score the probes on their consistency. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these belief directions influences the position of the hypothesis along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the (type of) model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that belief directions are (one of the) causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information. et.al.|[2404.18865](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18865)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**Performance-Aligned LLMs for Generating Fast Code**|Optimizing scientific software is a difficult task because codebases are often large and complex, and performance can depend upon several factors including the algorithm, its implementation, and hardware among others. Causes of poor performance can originate from disparate sources and be difficult to diagnose. Recent years have seen a multitude of work that use large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development tasks. However, these tools are trained to model the distribution of code as text, and are not specifically designed to understand performance aspects of code. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning based methodology to align the outputs of code LLMs with performance. This allows us to build upon the current code modeling capabilities of LLMs and extend them to generate better performing code. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model improves the expected speedup of generated code over base models for a set of benchmark tasks from 0.9 to 1.6 for serial code and 1.9 to 4.5 for OpenMP code. et.al.|[2404.18864](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18864)|null|
|**2024-04-29**|**VERT: Verified Equivalent Rust Transpilation with Few-Shot Learning**|Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default. Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust. Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based. While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness. In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness. VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages. VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program. In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program. This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds. We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks. Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone. In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers. Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust. et.al.|[2404.18852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18852)|null|

A prerequisite for this is the availability of in-domain data annotated for sentiment. This article documents an effort to add sentiment annotations to free-text comments in patient surveys collected by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). However, annotation can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, particularly when it requires domain expertise. We therefore also evaluate a possible alternative to human annotation, using large language models (LLMs) as annotators. We perform an extensive evaluation of the approach for two openly available pretrained LLMs for Norwegian, experimenting with different configurations of prompts and in-context learning, comparing their performance to human annotators. We find that even for zero-shot runs, models perform well above the baseline for binary sentiment, but still cannot compete with human annotators on the full dataset. et.al.|[2404.18832](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18832)|null|
|**2024-04-26**|**Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo**|Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks. et.al.|[2404.17546](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17546)|null|

|**2024-04-26**|**Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer**|Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously. et.al.|[2404.17525](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17525)|null|

The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors. et.al.|[2404.17524](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17524)|null|

|**2024-04-26**|**A Comprehensive Evaluation on Event Reasoning of Large Language Models**|Event reasoning is a fundamental ability that underlies many applications. It requires event schema knowledge to perform global reasoning and needs to deal with the diversity of the inter-event relations and the reasoning paradigms. How well LLMs accomplish event reasoning on various relations and reasoning paradigms remains unknown. To mitigate this disparity, we comprehensively evaluate the abilities of event reasoning of LLMs. We introduce a novel benchmark EV2 for EValuation of EVent reasoning. EV2 consists of two levels of evaluation of schema and instance and is comprehensive in relations and reasoning paradigms. We conduct extensive experiments on EV2. We find that LLMs have abilities to accomplish event reasoning but their performances are far from satisfactory. We also notice the imbalance of event reasoning abilities in LLMs. Besides, LLMs have event schema knowledge, however, they're not aligned with humans on how to utilize the knowledge. Based on these findings, we introduce two methods to guide the LLMs to utilize the event schema knowledge. Both methods achieve improvements. et.al.|[2404.17513](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17513)|**[link](https://github.com/tzwwww/ev2)**|

They are recognized for promoting cognitive engagement and improving learning outcomes, especially in reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the cost associated with authoring CTS content is a major obstacle to widespread adoption and to research on effective instructional design. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate a novel type of CTS that leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First, the system enables AI-assisted content authoring by inducing an easily editable tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates the script orchestration in a learning-by-teaching format via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle&Riley) acting as a student and a professor. The system allows for free-form conversations that follow the ITS-typical inner and outer loop structure. We evaluate Ruffle&Riley's ability to support biology lessons in two between-subject online user studies (N = 200) comparing the system to simpler QA chatbots and reading activity. Analyzing system usage patterns, pre/post-test scores and user experience surveys, we find that Ruffle&Riley users report high levels of engagement, understanding and perceive the offered support as helpful. Even though Ruffle&Riley users require more time to complete the activity, we did not find significant differences in short-term learning gains over the reading activity. Our system architecture and user study provide various insights for designers of future CTSs. We further open-source our system to support ongoing research on effective instructional design of LLM-based learning technologies. et.al.|[2404.17460](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17460)|null|

Such technology will have profound implications for computing education, raising concerns about cheating, excessive dependence, and a decline in computational thinking skills, among others. There has been extensive research on how teachers should handle this challenge but it is also important to understand how students feel about this paradigm shift. In this research, 52 first-year CS students were surveyed in order to assess their views on technologies with code-generation capabilities, both from academic and professional perspectives. Our findings indicate that while students generally favor the academic use of GPT, they don't over rely on it, only mildly asking for its help. Although most students benefit from GPT, some struggle to use it effectively, urging the need for specific GPT training. Opinions on GPT's impact on their professional lives vary, but there is a consensus on its importance in academic practice. et.al.|[2404.17443](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17443)|null|

|**2024-04-26**|**When to Trust LLMs: Aligning Confidence with Response Quality**|Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation, much evidence shows that LLMs may produce incorrect or nonsensical text. This limitation highlights the importance of discerning when to trust LLMs, especially in safety-critical domains. Existing methods, which rely on verbalizing confidence to tell the reliability by inducing top-k responses and sampling-aggregating multiple responses, often fail, due to the lack of objective guidance of confidence. To address this, we propose CONfidence-Quality-ORDerpreserving alignment approach (CONQORD), leveraging reinforcement learning with a tailored dual-component reward function. This function encompasses quality reward and orderpreserving alignment reward functions. Specifically, the order-preserving reward incentivizes the model to verbalize greater confidence for responses of higher quality to align the order of confidence and quality. Experiments demonstrate that our CONQORD significantly improves the alignment performance between confidence levels and response accuracy, without causing the model to become over-cautious. Furthermore, the aligned confidence provided by CONQORD informs when to trust LLMs, and acts as a determinant for initiating the retrieval process of external knowledge. Aligning confidence with response quality ensures more transparent and reliable responses, providing better trustworthiness. et.al.|[2404.17287](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17287)|null|

We introduce three simple improvements: (1) Strong Vision Encoder: we explored a continuous learning strategy for the large-scale vision foundation model -- InternViT-6B, boosting its visual understanding capabilities, and making it can be transferred and reused in different LLMs. (2) Dynamic High-Resolution: we divide images into tiles ranging from 1 to 40 of 448 $\times$ 448 pixels according to the aspect ratio and resolution of the input images, which supports up to 4K resolution input. (3) High-Quality Bilingual Dataset: we carefully collected a high-quality bilingual dataset that covers common scenes, document images, and annotated them with English and Chinese question-answer pairs, significantly enhancing performance in OCR- and Chinese-related tasks.

India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation, we release IndicGenBench - the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user-facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. IndicGenBench is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering. IndicGenBench extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi-way parallel evaluation data for many under-represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate a wide range of proprietary and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, mT5, Gemma, BLOOM and LLaMA on IndicGenBench in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM-2 models performs the best on most tasks, however, there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models.

|**2024-04-25**|**Make Your LLM Fully Utilize the Context**|While many contemporary large language models (LLMs) can process lengthy input, they still struggle to fully utilize information within the long context, known as the lost-in-the-middle challenge. We hypothesize that it stems from insufficient explicit supervision during the long-context training, which fails to emphasize that any position in a long context can hold crucial information. Based on this intuition, our study presents information-intensive (IN2) training, a purely data-driven solution to overcome lost-in-the-middle. Specifically, IN2 training leverages a synthesized long-context question-answer dataset, where the answer requires (1) fine-grained information awareness on a short segment (~128 tokens) within a synthesized long context (4K-32K tokens), and (2) the integration and reasoning of information from two or more short segments. Through applying this information-intensive training on Mistral-7B, we present FILM-7B (FILl-in-the-Middle). To thoroughly assess the ability of FILM-7B for utilizing long contexts, we design three probing tasks that encompass various context styles (document, code, and structured-data context) and information retrieval patterns (forward, backward, and bi-directional retrieval). The probing results demonstrate that FILM-7B can robustly retrieve information from different positions in its 32K context window. Beyond these probing tasks, FILM-7B significantly improves the performance on real-world long-context tasks (e.g., 23.5->26.9 F1 score on NarrativeQA), while maintaining a comparable performance on short-context tasks (e.g., 59.3->59.2 accuracy on MMLU).

|**2024-04-25**|**Improving Diversity of Commonsense Generation by Large Language Models via In-Context Learning**|Generative Commonsense Reasoning (GCR) requires a model to reason about a situation using commonsense knowledge, while generating coherent sentences. Although the quality of the generated sentences is crucial, the diversity of the generation is equally important because it reflects the model's ability to use a range of commonsense knowledge facts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in enhancing the generation quality across various tasks through in-context learning (ICL) using given examples without the need for any fine-tuning. However, the diversity aspect in LLM outputs has not been systematically studied before. To address this, we propose a simple method that diversifies the LLM generations, while preserving their quality. Experimental results on three benchmark GCR datasets show that our method achieves an ideal balance between the quality and diversity. Moreover, the sentences generated by our proposed method can be used as training data to improve diversity in existing commonsense generators. et.al.|[2404.16807](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16807)|null|
|**2024-04-25**|**Weak-to-Strong Extrapolation Expedites Alignment**|Although the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) ideally scale up with increasing data and compute, they are inevitably constrained by limited resources in reality. Suppose we have a moderately trained LLM (e.g., trained to align with human preference) in hand, can we further exploit its potential and cheaply acquire a stronger model? In this paper, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. ExPO assumes that a medium-aligned model can be interpolated between a less-aligned (weaker) model, e.g., the initial SFT model, and a better-aligned (stronger) one, thereby directly obtaining this stronger model by extrapolating from the weights of the former two relatively weaker models. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, we show that ExPO pushes models trained with less preference data (e.g., 10% or 20%) to reach and even surpass the fully-trained one, without any additional training. Furthermore, ExPO also significantly improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models and exhibits decent scalability across model sizes from 7B to 70B. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in exploiting LLMs' capabilities, suggesting a promising direction that deserves future exploration. et.al.|[2404.16792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16792)|**[link](https://github.com/chujiezheng/llm-extrapolation)**|

Recently, the advent of MLLMs with impressive versatility has raised the bar for what we can expect from MLLMs. However, their proficiency in text-rich scenarios has yet to be comprehensively and objectively assessed, since current MLLM benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating general visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce SEED-Bench-2-Plus, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating \textbf{text-rich visual comprehension} of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises 2.3K multiple-choice questions with precise human annotations, spanning three broad categories: Charts, Maps, and Webs, each of which covers a wide spectrum of text-rich scenarios in the real world. These categories, due to their inherent complexity and diversity, effectively simulate real-world text-rich environments. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving 34 prominent MLLMs (including GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision and Claude-3-Opus) and emphasize the current limitations of MLLMs in text-rich visual comprehension. We hope that our work can serve as a valuable addition to existing MLLM benchmarks, providing insightful observations and inspiring further research in the area of text-rich visual comprehension with MLLMs. The dataset and evaluation code can be accessed at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench. et.al.|[2404.16790](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16790)|**[link](https://github.com/ailab-cvc/seed-bench)**|
|**2024-04-25**|**Continual Learning of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey**|The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6). The full list of papers examined in this survey is available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/llm-continual-learning-survey. et.al.|[2404.16789](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16789)|**[link](https://github.com/wang-ml-lab/llm-continual-learning-survey)**|
|**2024-04-25**|**Prefix Text as a Yarn: Eliciting Non-English Alignment in Foundation Language Model**|While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely "superficial". We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs. et.al.|[2404.16766](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16766)|null|

A pivotal insight in developing these models is their reliance on dataset scaling, which emphasizes the requirements on developing open-source medical image datasets that incorporate diverse supervision signals across various imaging modalities. In this paper, we introduce RadGenome-Chest CT, a comprehensive, large-scale, region-guided 3D chest CT interpretation dataset based on CT-RATE. Specifically, we leverage the latest powerful universal segmentation and large language models, to extend the original datasets (over 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT volume and reports from 20,000 patients) from the following aspects: (i) organ-level segmentation masks covering 197 categories, which provide intermediate reasoning visual clues for interpretation; (ii) 665 K multi-granularity grounded reports, where each sentence of the report is linked to the corresponding anatomical region of CT volume in the form of a segmentation mask; (iii) 1.3 M grounded VQA pairs, where questions and answers are all linked with reference segmentation masks, enabling models to associate visual evidence with textual explanations. All grounded reports and VQA pairs in the validation set have gone through manual verification to ensure dataset quality. We believe that RadGenome-Chest CT can significantly advance the development of multimodal medical foundation models, by training to generate texts based on given segmentation regions, which is unattainable with previous relevant datasets. We will release all segmentation masks, grounded reports, and VQA pairs to facilitate further research and development in this field. et.al.|[2404.16754](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16754)|null|

To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains.

Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions.

There is strong evidence that these models can perform remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks. However, how to leverage them to approach domain-specific use cases and drive value remains an open question. In this work, we focus on a specific use case, pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations, and propose that leveraging historical records of manufacturing incidents and deviations in an organization can be beneficial for addressing and closing new cases, or de-risking new manufacturing campaigns. Using a small but diverse dataset of real manufacturing deviations selected from different product lines, we evaluate and quantify the power of three general purpose LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2) in performing tasks related to the above goal. In particular, (1) the ability of LLMs in automating the process of extracting specific information such as root cause of a case from unstructured data, as well as (2) the possibility of identifying similar or related deviations by performing semantic search on the database of historical records are examined. While our results point to the high accuracy of GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the information extraction task, we discuss cases of complex interplay between the apparent reasoning and hallucination behavior of LLMs as a risk factor. Furthermore, we show that semantic search on vector embedding of deviation descriptions can be used to identify similar records, such as those with a similar type of defect, with a high level of accuracy. We discuss further improvements to enhance the accuracy of similar record identification. et.al.|[2404.15578](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15578)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**PRISM: Patient Records Interpretation for Semantic Clinical Trial Matching using Large Language Models**|Clinical trial matching is the task of identifying trials for which patients may be potentially eligible. Typically, this task is labor-intensive and requires detailed verification of patient electronic health records (EHRs) against the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials. This process is manual, time-intensive, and challenging to scale up, resulting in many patients missing out on potential therapeutic options. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made automating patient-trial matching possible, as shown in multiple concurrent research studies. However, the current approaches are confined to constrained, often synthetic datasets that do not adequately mirror the complexities encountered in real-world medical data. In this study, we present the first, end-to-end large-scale empirical evaluation of clinical trial matching using real-world EHRs. Our study showcases the capability of LLMs to accurately match patients with appropriate clinical trials. We perform experiments with proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, as well as our custom fine-tuned model called OncoLLM and show that OncoLLM, despite its significantly smaller size, not only outperforms GPT-3.5 but also matches the performance of qualified medical doctors.

|**2024-04-23**|**Towards Systematic Evaluation of Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models**|Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really "reason" over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/LogicBench. et.al.|[2404.15522](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15522)|**[link](https://github.com/mihir3009/logicbench)**|

Current techniques rely on supervised learning for CIR models using labeled triplets of the reference image, text, target image. These specific triplets are not as commonly available as simple image-text pairs, limiting the widespread use of CIR and its scalability. On the other hand, zero-shot CIR can be relatively easily trained with image-caption pairs without considering the image-to-image relation, but this approach tends to yield lower accuracy. We propose a new semi-supervised CIR approach where we search for a reference and its related target images in auxiliary data and learn our large language model-based Visual Delta Generator (VDG) to generate text describing the visual difference (i.e., visual delta) between the two. VDG, equipped with fluent language knowledge and being model agnostic, can generate pseudo triplets to boost the performance of CIR models. Our approach significantly improves the existing supervised learning approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CIR benchmarks. et.al.|[2404.15516](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15516)|null|

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown some promise with ToM ability, they still struggle with complex ToM reasoning. Our approach leverages an external symbolic executor, specifically the SMCDEL model checker, and fine-tuning to improve the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs. In our approach, an LLM is first fine-tuned through pairs of natural language and symbolic formulation representation of ToM problems and is then instructed to generate the symbolic formulation with a one-shot in-context example. The generated symbolic formulation is then executed by the SMCDEL model checker to perform transparent and verifiable ToM reasoning and give the final result. We demonstrate that our approach, ToM-LM, shows a significant improvement over all the constructed baselines. Our study proposes a novel view about externalizing a particular component of ToM reasoning, mainly reasoning about beliefs, and suggests generalizing it to other aspects of ToM reasoning. et.al.|[2404.15515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15515)|null|

This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a suite of four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the process by observing, analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to guide the search to target a potential error in the clinical notes. Subsequently, the MedEval agent employs five evaluators to assess the targeted error and the proposed correction. In cases where MedReAct's actions prove insufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging in reflective analysis and proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser agent formats the final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the integrity of the error correction process. One core component of our method is our RAG pipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources containing clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the open-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application.

By leveraging clever social engineering elements and modern technology, cybercrime targets many individuals, businesses, and organizations to exploit trust and security. These cyber-attackers are often disguised in many trustworthy forms to appear as legitimate sources. By cleverly using psychological elements like urgency, fear, social proof, and other manipulative strategies, phishers can lure individuals into revealing sensitive and personalized information. Building on this pervasive issue within modern technology, this paper aims to analyze the effectiveness of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting phishing attempts, specifically focusing on a randomized set of "419 Scam" emails. The objective is to determine which LLMs can accurately detect phishing emails by analyzing a text file containing email metadata based on predefined criteria. The experiment concluded that the following models, ChatGPT 3.5, GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct, and ChatGPT, were the most effective in detecting phishing emails. et.al.|[2404.15485](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15485)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Can Large Language Models Learn the Physics of Metamaterials? An Empirical Study with ChatGPT**|Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, LlaMa, and Claude are trained on massive quantities of text parsed from the internet and have shown a remarkable ability to respond to complex prompts in a manner often indistinguishable from humans. We present a LLM fine-tuned on up to 40,000 data that can predict electromagnetic spectra over a range of frequencies given a text prompt that only specifies the metasurface geometry. Results are compared to conventional machine learning approaches including feed-forward neural networks, random forest, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Remarkably, the fine-tuned LLM (FT-LLM) achieves a lower error across all dataset sizes explored compared to all machine learning approaches including a deep neural network. We also demonstrate the LLM's ability to solve inverse problems by providing the geometry necessary to achieve a desired spectrum. LLMs possess some advantages over humans that may give them benefits for research, including the ability to process enormous amounts of data, find hidden patterns in data, and operate in higher-dimensional spaces. We propose that fine-tuning LLMs on large datasets specific to a field allows them to grasp the nuances of that domain, making them valuable tools for research and analysis. et.al.|[2404.15458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15458)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits**|We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference. On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences et.al.|[2404.15269](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**XFT: Unlocking the Power of Code Instruction Tuning by Simply Merging Upcycled Mixture-of-Experts**|We introduce XFT, a simple yet powerful training scheme, by simply merging upcycled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to unleash the performance limit of instruction-tuned code Large Language Models (LLMs). While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning, XFT introduces a shared expert mechanism with a novel routing weight normalization strategy into sparse upcycling, which significantly boosts instruction tuning. After fine-tuning the upcycled MoE model, XFT introduces a learnable model merging mechanism to compile the upcycled MoE model back to a dense model, achieving upcycled MoE-level performance with only dense-model compute. By applying XFT to a 1.3B model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM (<3B) with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. With the same data and model architecture, XFT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by 13% on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from 2% to 13% on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability. XFT is fully orthogonal to existing techniques such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-Instruct, opening a new dimension for improving code instruction tuning.

|**2024-04-23**|**Revisiting Unnaturalness for Automated Program Repair in the Era of Large Language Models**|Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers. One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code. We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks. While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem. However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage. In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR. We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools. Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL. We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing. When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1. Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem. et.al.|[2404.15236](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15236)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Re-Thinking Inverse Graphics With Large Language Models**|Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems. To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation. We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision. Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ et.al.|[2404.15228](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15228)|null|

Examples of task performance expressed in English are abundant, so with a high-quality translation system our community will be enabled to curate datasets faster. To aid this goal, we introduce a recipe to build a translation system using supervised finetuning of a large pretrained language model with a noisy parallel dataset of 3M pairs of Ukrainian and English sentences followed by a second phase of training using 17K examples selected by k-fold perplexity filtering on another dataset of higher quality.

|**2024-04-23**|**Regressive Side Effects of Training Language Models to Mimic Student Misconceptions**|This paper presents a novel exploration into the regressive side effects of training Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic student misconceptions for personalized education. We highlight the problem that as LLMs are trained to more accurately mimic student misconceptions, there is a compromise in the factual integrity and reasoning ability of the models. Our work involved training an LLM on a student-tutor dialogue dataset to predict student responses. The results demonstrated a decrease in the model's performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including the ARC reasoning challenge and TruthfulQA, which evaluates the truthfulness of model's generated responses. Furthermore, the HaluEval Dial dataset, used for hallucination detection, and MemoTrap, a memory-based task dataset, also reported a decline in the model accuracy. To combat these side effects, we introduced a "hallucination token" technique. This token, appended at the beginning of each student response during training, instructs the model to switch between mimicking student misconceptions and providing factually accurate responses. Despite the significant improvement across all datasets, the technique does not completely restore the LLM's baseline performance, indicating the need for further research in this area. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on the use of LLMs for student modeling, emphasizing the need for a balance between personalized education and factual accuracy. et.al.|[2404.15156](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15156)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Bias patterns in the application of LLMs for clinical decision support: A comprehensive study**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes. While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations. We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications. et.al.|[2404.15149](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15149)|null|
|**2024-04-23**|**Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression**|Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$ . In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself. In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.

|**2024-04-23**|**Multimodal Large Language Model is a Human-Aligned Annotator for Text-to-Image Generation**|Recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of leveraging human preference datasets to refine text-to-image generative models, enhancing the alignment between generated images and textual prompts. Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges and promote the alignment of generative models through instruction tuning, we leverage multimodal large language models to create VisionPrefer, a high-quality and fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects. We aggregate feedback from AI annotators across four aspects: prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness to construct VisionPrefer. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer, we train a reward model VP-Score over VisionPrefer to guide the training of text-to-image generative models and the preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is comparable to human annotators. Furthermore, we use two reinforcement learning methods to supervised fine-tune generative models to evaluate the performance of VisionPrefer, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that VisionPrefer significantly improves text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, e.g., aesthetic, and generalizes better than previous human-preference metrics across various image distributions. Moreover, VisionPrefer indicates that the integration of AI-generated synthetic data as a supervisory signal is a promising avenue for achieving improved alignment with human preferences in vision generative models. et.al.|[2404.15100](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15100)|null|

However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures. et.al.|[2404.14408](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14408)|**[link](https://github.com/kjslag/spacebyte)**|

With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt, and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microagressions, bias). We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment. et.al.|[2404.14397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14397)|null|
|**2024-04-22**|**A Survey on Self-Evolution of Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in various fields and intelligent agent applications. However, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as task complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution approaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new training paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers the potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a conceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as iterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience refinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and provide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing challenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of self-evolving LLMs. et.al.|[2404.14387](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14387)|null|
|**2024-04-22**|**Beyond Scaling: Predicting Patent Approval with Domain-specific Fine-grained Claim Dependency Graph**|Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs). However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly. We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs. Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph. et.al.|[2404.14372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14372)|**[link](https://github.com/shangdatalab/flan-graph)**|
|**2024-04-23**|**Preference Fine-Tuning of LLMs Should Leverage Suboptimal, On-Policy Data**|Learning from preference labels plays a crucial role in fine-tuning large language models. There are several distinct approaches for preference fine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), and contrastive learning. Different methods come with different implementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical findings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that online RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others find (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. This raises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for fine-tuning with preference data and why? In this paper, we answer this question by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning techniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that, in general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the likelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a "negative gradient") outperform offline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and unify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion of mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking objectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical distribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to relocate masses across bins more effectively. Our analysis prescribes actionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data should be collected for maximal improvement. et.al.|[2404.14367](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14367)|**[link](https://github.com/Asap7772/understanding-rlhf)**|
|**2024-04-22**|**Better Synthetic Data by Retrieving and Transforming Existing Datasets**|Despite recent advances in large language models, building dependable and deployable NLP models typically requires abundant, high-quality training data. However, task-specific data is not available for many use cases, and manually curating task-specific data is labor-intensive. Recent work has studied prompt-driven synthetic data generation using large language models, but these generated datasets tend to lack complexity and diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce a method, \textit{DataTune}, to make better use of existing, publicly available datasets to improve automatic dataset generation. DataTune performs dataset transformation, enabling the repurposing of publicly available datasets into a format that is directly aligned with the specific requirements of target tasks. On a diverse set of language-based tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, we find that finetuning language models via DataTune improves over a few-shot prompting baseline by 49\% and improves over existing methods that use synthetic or retrieved training data by 34\%. We find that dataset transformation significantly increases the diversity and difficulty of generated data on many tasks.

Despite advances in the Requirements Engineering (RE) community on legal compliance analysis, important obstacles remain in developing accurate and generalizable compliance automation solutions. This paper highlights some observed limitations of current approaches and examines how adopting new automation strategies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these shortcomings and open up fresh opportunities. Specifically, we argue that the examination of (textual) legal artifacts should, first, employ a broader context than sentences, which have widely been used as the units of analysis in past research. Second, the mode of analysis with legal artifacts needs to shift from classification and information extraction to more end-to-end strategies that are not only accurate but also capable of providing explanation and justification. We present a compliance analysis approach designed to address these limitations. We further outline our evaluation plan for the approach and provide preliminary evaluation results based on data processing agreements (DPAs) that must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our initial findings suggest that our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements and, at the same time, provides justification for compliance decisions. et.al.|[2404.14356](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14356)|null|
|**2024-04-22**|**Automated Long Answer Grading with RiceChem Dataset**|We introduce a new area of study in the field of educational Natural Language Processing: Automated Long Answer Grading (ALAG). Distinguishing itself from Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and Automated Essay Grading (AEG), ALAG presents unique challenges due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of fact-based long answers. To study ALAG, we introduce RiceChem, a dataset derived from a college chemistry course, featuring real student responses to long-answer questions with an average word count notably higher than typical ASAG datasets. We propose a novel approach to ALAG by formulating it as a rubric entailment problem, employing natural language inference models to verify whether each criterion, represented by a rubric item, is addressed in the student's response. This formulation enables the effective use of MNLI for transfer learning, significantly improving the performance of models on the RiceChem dataset. We demonstrate the importance of rubric-based formulation in ALAG, showcasing its superiority over traditional score-based approaches in capturing the nuances of student responses. We also investigate the performance of models in cold start scenarios, providing valuable insights into the practical deployment considerations in educational settings. Lastly, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) on RiceChem and compare their results to GPT models, highlighting the increased complexity of ALAG compared to ASAG. Despite leveraging the benefits of a rubric-based approach and transfer learning from MNLI, the lower performance of LLMs on RiceChem underscores the significant difficulty posed by the ALAG task. With this work, we offer a fresh perspective on grading long, fact-based answers and introduce a new dataset to stimulate further research in this important area.

|**2024-04-19**|**MoVA: Adapting Mixture of Vision Experts to Multimodal Context**|As the key component in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the ability of the visual encoder greatly affects MLLM's understanding on diverse image content. Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as vision encoders in CLIP and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found that there is still no single vision encoder that can dominate various image content understanding, e.g., the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results on general image understanding but poor performance on document or chart content. To alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism. In the coarse-grained stage, we design a context-aware expert routing strategy to dynamically select the most suitable vision experts according to the user instruction, input image, and expertise of vision experts. This benefits from the powerful model function understanding ability of the large language model (LLM) equipped with expert-routing low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In the fine-grained stage, we elaborately conduct the mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-Adapter) to extract and fuse task-specific knowledge from various experts. This coarse-to-fine paradigm effectively leverages representations from experts based on multimodal context and model expertise, further enhancing the generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without any bells and whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance gains over current state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of challenging multimodal benchmarks.

|**2024-04-19**|**Unified Scene Representation and Reconstruction for 3D Large Language Models**|Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with 3D environments is challenging. Existing approaches extract point clouds either from ground truth (GT) geometry or 3D scenes reconstructed by auxiliary models. Text-image aligned 2D features from CLIP are then lifted to point clouds, which serve as inputs for LLMs. However, this solution lacks the establishment of 3D point-to-point connections, leading to a deficiency of spatial structure information. Concurrently, the absence of integration and unification between the geometric and semantic representations of the scene culminates in a diminished level of 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of having a unified scene representation and reconstruction framework, which is essential for LLMs in 3D scenes. Specifically, we introduce Uni3DR^2 extracts 3D geometric and semantic aware representation features via the frozen pre-trained 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) and a multi-scale aggregate 3D decoder. Our learned 3D representations not only contribute to the reconstruction process but also provide valuable knowledge for LLMs. Experimental results validate that our Uni3DR^2 yields convincing gains over the baseline on the 3D reconstruction dataset ScanNet (increasing F-Score by +1.8\%). When applied to LLMs, our Uni3DR^2-LLM exhibits superior performance over the baseline on the 3D vision-language understanding dataset ScanQA (increasing BLEU-1 by +4.0\% and +4.2\% on the val set and test set, respectively). Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method that uses additional GT point clouds on both ScanQA and 3DMV-VQA. et.al.|[2404.13044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13044)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Data Alignment for Zero-Shot Concept Generation in Dermatology AI**|AI in dermatology is evolving at a rapid pace but the major limitation to training trustworthy classifiers is the scarcity of data with ground-truth concept level labels, which are meta-labels semantically meaningful to humans. Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance. et.al.|[2404.13043](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13043)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Sample Design Engineering: An Empirical Study of What Makes Good Downstream Fine-Tuning Samples for LLMs**|In the burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA, Prompt Engineering (PE) is renowned for boosting zero-shot or in-context learning (ICL) through prompt modifications. Yet, the realm of the sample design for downstream fine-tuning, crucial for task-specific LLM adaptation, is largely unexplored. This paper introduces Sample Design Engineering (SDE), a methodical approach to enhancing LLMs' post-tuning performance by refining input, output, and reasoning designs. We conduct a series of in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) experiments to assess the impact of various design options on LLMs' downstream performance, revealing several intriguing patterns that hold consistently across different LLMs. Based on these insights, we propose an integrated SDE strategy, combining the most effective options, and validate its consistent superiority over heuristic sample designs in complex downstream tasks like multi-aspect sentiment analysis, event extraction, and nested entity recognition. Additionally, analyses of LLMs' inherent prompt/output perplexity, zero-shot, and ICL abilities illustrate that good PE strategies may not always translate to good SDE strategies.

This strategy enhances model adaptability to new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge.

Beyond holistic image understanding, Groma is adept at region-level tasks such as region captioning and visual grounding. Such capabilities are built upon a localized visual tokenization mechanism, where an image input is decomposed into regions of interest and subsequently encoded into region tokens. By integrating region tokens into user instructions and model responses, we seamlessly enable Groma to understand user-specified region inputs and ground its textual output to images. Besides, to enhance the grounded chat ability of Groma, we curate a visually grounded instruction dataset by leveraging the powerful GPT-4V and visual prompting techniques. Compared with MLLMs that rely on the language model or external module for localization, Groma consistently demonstrates superior performances in standard referring and grounding benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of embedding localization into image tokenization.

|**2024-04-19**|**Rethinking the Evaluation of Dialogue Systems: Effects of User Feedback on Crowdworkers and LLMs**|In ad-hoc retrieval, evaluation relies heavily on user actions, including implicit feedback. In a conversational setting such signals are usually unavailable due to the nature of the interactions, and, instead, the evaluation often relies on crowdsourced evaluation labels. The role of user feedback in annotators' assessment of turns in a conversational perception has been little studied. We focus on how the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), is affected by considering user feedback, explicit or implicit, as provided through the follow-up utterance of a turn being evaluated. We explore and compare two methodologies for assessing TDSs: one includes the user's follow-up utterance and one without. We use both crowdworkers and large language models (LLMs) as annotators to assess system responses across four aspects: relevance, usefulness, interestingness, and explanation quality. Our findings indicate that there is a distinct difference in ratings assigned by both annotator groups in the two setups, indicating user feedback does influence system evaluation. Workers are more susceptible to user feedback on usefulness and interestingness compared to LLMs on interestingness and relevance. User feedback leads to a more personalized assessment of usefulness by workers, aligning closely with the user's explicit feedback. Additionally, in cases of ambiguous or complex user requests, user feedback improves agreement among crowdworkers. These findings emphasize the significance of user feedback in refining system evaluations and suggest the potential for automated feedback integration in future research. We publicly release the annotated data to foster research in this area. et.al.|[2404.12994](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12994)|**[link](https://github.com/clemenciah/llmcrowddialogueeval)**|
|**2024-04-19**|**FineRec:Exploring Fine-grained Sequential Recommendation**|Sequential recommendation is dedicated to offering items of interest for users based on their history behaviors. The attribute-opinion pairs, expressed by users in their reviews for items, provide the potentials to capture user preferences and item characteristics at a fine-grained level. To this end, we propose a novel framework FineRec that explores the attribute-opinion pairs of reviews to finely handle sequential recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a large language model to extract attribute-opinion pairs from reviews. For each attribute, a unique attribute-specific user-opinion-item graph is created, where corresponding opinions serve as the edges linking heterogeneous user and item nodes. To tackle the diversity of opinions, we devise a diversity-aware convolution operation to aggregate information within the graphs, enabling attribute-specific user and item representation learning. Ultimately, we present an interaction-driven fusion mechanism to integrate attribute-specific user/item representations across all attributes for generating recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on several realworld datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FineRec over existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis also verifies the effectiveness of our fine-grained manner in handling the task. et.al.|[2404.12975](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12975)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Eyes Can Deceive: Benchmarking Counterfactual Reasoning Abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models**|Counterfactual reasoning, as a crucial manifestation of human intelligence, refers to making presuppositions based on established facts and extrapolating potential outcomes. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive cognitive and reasoning capabilities, which have been examined across a wide range of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. Nevertheless, how will existing MLLMs perform when faced with counterfactual questions? To answer this question, we first curate a novel \textbf{C}ounter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal reasoning benchmark, abbreviated as \textbf{CFMM}, to systematically assess the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Our CFMM comprises six challenging tasks, each including hundreds of carefully human-labeled counterfactual questions, to evaluate MLLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities across diverse aspects. Through experiments, interestingly, we find that existing MLLMs prefer to believe what they see, but ignore the counterfactual presuppositions presented in the question, thereby leading to inaccurate responses. Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of prevalent MLLMs on our proposed CFMM. The significant gap between their performance on our CFMM and that on several VQA benchmarks indicates that there is still considerable room for improvement in existing MLLMs toward approaching human-level intelligence. On the other hand, through boosting MLLMs performances on our CFMM in the future, potential avenues toward developing MLLMs with advanced intelligence can be explored. et.al.|[2404.12966](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12966)|null|
|**2024-04-19**|**Towards Reliable Latent Knowledge Estimation in LLMs: In-Context Learning vs. Prompting Based Factual Knowledge Extraction**|We propose an approach for estimating the latent knowledge embedded inside large language models (LLMs). We leverage the in-context learning (ICL) abilities of LLMs to estimate the extent to which an LLM knows the facts stored in a knowledge base. Our knowledge estimator avoids reliability concerns with previous prompting-based methods, is both conceptually simpler and easier to apply, and we demonstrate that it can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also investigate how different design choices affect the performance of ICL-based knowledge estimation. Using the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the factual knowledge of a variety of open source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2), Mistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata knowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between different model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are consistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise facts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their finetuned counterparts. et.al.|[2404.12957](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12957)|null|
|**2024-04-18**|**BLINK: Multimodal Large Language Models Can See but Not Perceive**|We introduce Blink, a new benchmark for multimodal language models (LLMs) that focuses on core visual perception abilities not found in other evaluations. Most of the Blink tasks can be solved by humans "within a blink" (e.g., relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection, and multi-view reasoning). However, we find these perception-demanding tasks cast significant challenges for current multimodal LLMs because they resist mediation through natural language. Blink reformats 14 classic computer vision tasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions, paired with single or multiple images and visual prompting. While humans get 95.70% accuracy on average, Blink is surprisingly challenging for existing multimodal LLMs: even the best-performing GPT-4V and Gemini achieve accuracies of 51.26% and 45.72%, only 13.17% and 7.63% higher than random guessing, indicating that such perception abilities have not "emerged" yet in recent multimodal LLMs. Our analysis also highlights that specialist CV models could solve these problems much better, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements. We believe Blink will stimulate the community to help multimodal LLMs catch up with human-level visual perception. et.al.|[2404.12390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12390)|null|

This technical report discusses details of training some of these models and provides comprehensive evaluation results. We show that Reka Edge and Reka Flash are not only state-of-the-art but also outperform many much larger models, delivering outsized values for their respective compute class.

It assists medical experts to swiftly interpret medical images, thereby enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. However, the model interpretability and transparency of existing MedVQA solutions are often limited, posing challenges in understanding their decision-making processes. To address this issue, we devise a semi-automated annotation process to streamlining data preparation and build new benchmark MedVQA datasets R-RAD and R-SLAKE. The R-RAD and R-SLAKE datasets provide intermediate medical decision-making rationales generated by multimodal large language models and human annotations for question-answering pairs in existing MedVQA datasets, i.e., VQA-RAD and SLAKE. Moreover, we design a novel framework which finetunes lightweight pretrained generative models by incorporating medical decision-making rationales into the training process. The framework includes three distinct strategies to generate decision outcomes and corresponding rationales, thereby clearly showcasing the medical decision-making process during reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve an accuracy of 83.5% on R-RAD and 86.3% on R-SLAKE, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines.

In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities. et.al.|[2404.12355](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355)|**[link](https://github.com/felix-lyx/prose)**|
|**2024-04-18**|**V2Xum-LLM: Cross-Modal Video Summarization with Temporal Prompt Instruction Tuning**|Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective fine-tuning of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39\%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks. et.al.|[2404.12353](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12353)|null|

We study sentiment analysis capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). We consider the dataset of RuSentNE-2023 in our study. The first group of experiments was aimed at the evaluation of zero-shot capabilities of LLMs with closed and open transparencies. The second covers the fine-tuning of Flan-T5 using the "chain-of-thought" (CoT) three-hop reasoning framework (THoR). We found that the results of the zero-shot approaches are similar to the results achieved by baseline fine-tuned encoder-based transformers (BERT-base). Reasoning capabilities of the fine-tuned Flan-T5 models with THoR achieve at least 5% increment with the base-size model compared to the results of the zero-shot experiment.

|**2024-04-18**|**Normative Requirements Operationalization with Large Language Models**|Normative non-functional requirements specify constraints that a system must observe in order to avoid violations of social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural norms. As these requirements are typically defined by non-technical system stakeholders with different expertise and priorities (ethicists, lawyers, social scientists, etc.), ensuring their well-formedness and consistency is very challenging. Recent research has tackled this challenge using a domain-specific language to specify normative requirements as rules whose consistency can then be analysed with formal methods. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that uses Large Language Models to extract semantic relationships between abstract representations of system capabilities. These relations, which are often assumed implicitly by non-technical stakeholders (e.g., based on common sense or domain knowledge), are then used to enrich the automated reasoning techniques for eliciting and analyzing the consistency of normative requirements. We show the effectiveness of our approach to normative requirements elicitation and operationalization through a range of real-world case studies. et.al.|[2404.12335](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12335)|null|

These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent.

However, it is very challenging to curate such a corpus due to limitations in the abilities of annotators, and hence, existing SI corpora are limited. Therefore, we propose a method to convert existing speech translation corpora into interpretation-style data, maintaining the original word order and preserving the entire source content using Large Language Models (LLM-SI-Corpus). We demonstrate that fine-tuning SiMT models in text-to-text and speech-to-text settings with the LLM-SI-Corpus reduces latencies while maintaining the same level of quality as the models trained with offline datasets.

|**2024-04-17**|**A Deep Dive into Large Language Models for Automated Bug Localization and Repair**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including automated program repair (APR). In this study, we take a deep dive into automated bug fixing utilizing LLMs. In contrast to many deep learning-based APR methods that assume known bug locations, rely on line-level localization tools, or address bug prediction and fixing in one step, our approach uniquely employs LLMs to predict bug location at the token level and subsequently utilizes them for bug fixing. This methodological separation of bug localization and fixing using different LLMs enables effective integration of diverse contextual information and improved incorporation of inductive biases. We introduce Toggle: Token-Granulated Bug Localization and Repair, a comprehensive program repair framework that integrates a bug localization model, an adjustment unit, and a bug-fixing model. Toggle takes a buggy function as input and generates a complete corrected function. We investigate various styles of prompting to the bug fixing model to identify the most effective prompts that better utilize the inductive bias and significantly outperform others. Toggle achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CodeXGLUE code refinement benchmark, and exhibits better and comparable performance on several other widely-used APR datasets, including Defects4J. et.al.|[2404.11595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11595)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**LLMTune: Accelerate Database Knob Tuning with Large Language Models**|Database knob tuning is a critical challenge in the database community, aiming to optimize knob values to enhance database performance for specific workloads. DBMS often feature hundreds of tunable knobs, posing a significant challenge for DBAs to recommend optimal configurations. Consequently, many machine learning-based tuning methods have been developed to automate this process. Despite the introduction of various optimizers, practical applications have unveiled a new problem: they typically require numerous workload runs to achieve satisfactory performance, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This inefficiency largely stems from the optimal configuration often being substantially different from the default setting, necessitating multiple iterations during tuning. Recognizing this, we argue that an effective starting point could significantly reduce redundant exploration in less efficient areas, thereby potentially speeding up the tuning process for the optimizers. Based on this assumption, we introduce LLMTune, a large language model-based configuration generator designed to produce an initial, high-quality configuration for new workloads. These generated configurations can then serve as starting points for various base optimizers, accelerating their tuning processes. To obtain training data for LLMTune's supervised fine-tuning, we have devised a new automatic data generation framework capable of efficiently creating a large number of <workload, configuration> pairs. We have conducted thorough experiments to evaluate LLMTune's effectiveness with different workloads, such as TPC-H and JOB. In comparison to leading methods, LLMTune demonstrates a quicker ability to identify superior configurations. For instance, with the challenging TPC-H workload, our LLMTune achieves a significant 15.6x speed-up ratio in finding the best-performing configurations. et.al.|[2404.11581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11581)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**MoA: Mixture-of-Attention for Subject-Context Disentanglement in Personalized Image Generation**|We introduce a new architecture for personalization of text-to-image diffusion models, coined Mixture-of-Attention (MoA). Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism utilized in large language models (LLMs), MoA distributes the generation workload between two attention pathways: a personalized branch and a non-personalized prior branch. MoA is designed to retain the original model's prior by fixing its attention layers in the prior branch, while minimally intervening in the generation process with the personalized branch that learns to embed subjects in the layout and context generated by the prior branch. A novel routing mechanism manages the distribution of pixels in each layer across these branches to optimize the blend of personalized and generic content creation. Once trained, MoA facilitates the creation of high-quality, personalized images featuring multiple subjects with compositions and interactions as diverse as those generated by the original model. Crucially, MoA enhances the distinction between the model's pre-existing capability and the newly augmented personalized intervention, thereby offering a more disentangled subject-context control that was previously unattainable.

|**2024-04-17**|**Quantifying Multilingual Performance of Large Language Models Across Languages**|The training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires extensive text corpus. However, these data are often unevenly distributed in different languages. As a result, LLMs perform well on common languages, such as English, German, and French, but perform poorly on low-resource languages. However, currently there is no work to quantitatively measure the performance of LLMs in low-resource languages. To fill this gap, we proposed the Language Ranker that aims to benchmark and rank different languages according to the performance of LLMs on those languages. We employ the LLM's performance on the English corpus as a baseline to compare the performances of different languages and English. We have the following three findings: 1. The performance rankings of different LLMs in all languages are roughly the same. 2. LLMs with different sizes have the same partial order of performance. 3. There is a strong correlation between LlaMa2's performance in different languages and the proportion of the pre-training corpus. These findings illustrate that the Language Ranker can be used as an indicator to measure the language performance of LLMs. et.al.|[2404.11553](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11553)|null|
|**2024-04-17**|**Pack of LLMs: Model Fusion at Test-Time via Perplexity Optimization**|Fusing knowledge from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) can combine their diverse strengths to achieve improved performance on a given task. However, current fusion approaches either rely on learning-based fusers that do not generalize to new LLMs, or do not take into account how well each LLM understands the input. In this work, we study LLM fusion at test-time, which enables leveraging knowledge from arbitrary user-specified LLMs during inference. We introduce Pack of LLMs (PackLLM), an effective method for test-time fusion that leverages each LLM's expertise, given an input prompt. PackLLM performs model fusion by solving an optimization problem for determining each LLM's importance, so that perplexity over the input prompt is minimized. First, our simple PackLLM-sim variant validates that perplexity is a good indicator for measuring each LLM's expertise. Second, our PackLLM-opt variant approximately solves the perplexity minimization problem via a greedy algorithm. The derived importance weights are used to combine the LLMs during inference. We conduct experiments with over 100 total LLMs on a diverse set of tasks. Experimental results show that (i) perplexity is a reliable measure for LLM fusion, (ii) PackLLM outperforms test-time fusion baselines by 1.89% accuracy points, and (iii) PackLLM can leverage new LLMs to improve performance over learning-based fusion approaches by 3.92-11.94% accuracy points. et.al.|[2404.11531](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11531)|null|

It ensures that individuals are free to engage in discussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline without fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or otherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical factor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on individuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced computational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if inappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to adverse effects for individuals - especially vulnerable groups - and society.

|**2024-04-17**|**Towards Coarse-to-Fine Evaluation of Inference Efficiency for Large Language Models**|In real world, large language models (LLMs) can serve as the assistant to help users accomplish their jobs, and also support the development of advanced applications. For the wide application of LLMs, the inference efficiency is an essential concern, which has been widely studied in existing work, and numerous optimization algorithms and code libraries have been proposed to improve it. Nonetheless, users still find it challenging to compare the effectiveness of all the above methods and understand the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we perform a detailed coarse-to-fine analysis of the inference performance of various code libraries. To evaluate the overall effectiveness, we examine four usage scenarios within two practical applications. We further provide both theoretical and empirical fine-grained analyses of each module in the Transformer architecture. Our experiments yield comprehensive results that are invaluable for researchers to evaluate code libraries and improve inference strategies. et.al.|[2404.11502](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11502)|**[link](https://github.com/rucaibox/coarse-to-fine-evaluation-of-inference-efficiency)**|

We find that subtle alterations in the surface form can significantly impact the answer distribution and the solve rate, exposing the language model's lack of robustness and sensitivity to the surface form in reasoning through complex problems. To improve mathematical reasoning performance, we propose Self-Consistency-over-Paraphrases (SCoP), which diversifies reasoning paths from specific surface forms of the problem. We evaluate our approach on four mathematics reasoning benchmarks over three large language models and show that SCoP improves mathematical reasoning performance over vanilla self-consistency, particularly for problems initially deemed unsolvable. Finally, we provide additional experiments and discussion regarding problem difficulty and surface forms, including cross-model difficulty agreement and paraphrasing transferability, and Variance of Variations (VOV) for language model evaluation. et.al.|[2404.11500](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11500)|**[link](https://github.com/yue-llm-pit/scop)**|

This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era.

However, the effectiveness of this approach can be influenced by adversaries, who may intentionally provide misleading preferences to manipulate the output in an undesirable or harmful direction. To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this problem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm namely robust contextual dueling bandit (\algo), which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}+dC)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, and $ 0 \le C \le T$ is the total number of adversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$ ) adversarial feedback. Additionally, we conduct experiments to evaluate our proposed algorithm against various types of adversarial feedback. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms in the presence of adversarial feedback. et.al.|[2404.10776](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10776)|null|

With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM).

Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%. et.al.|[2404.10757](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10757)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment? A Comprehensive Study**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is currently the most widely used method to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Existing RLHF methods can be roughly categorized as either reward-based or reward-free. Novel applications such as ChatGPT and Claude leverage reward-based methods that first learn a reward model and apply actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, in academic benchmarks, state-of-the-art results are often achieved via reward-free methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Is DPO truly superior to PPO? Why does PPO perform poorly on these benchmarks? In this paper, we first conduct both theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithmic properties of DPO and show that DPO may have fundamental limitations. Moreover, we also comprehensively examine PPO and reveal the key factors for the best performances of PPO in fine-tuning LLMs. Finally, we benchmark DPO and PPO across various a collection of RLHF testbeds, ranging from dialogue to code generation. Experiment results demonstrate that PPO is able to surpass other alignment methods in all cases and achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging code competitions. et.al.|[2404.10719](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10719)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**An empirical study on code review activity prediction in practice**|During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase. This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the code submitted, as well as the author's and the reviewer's experience, leading to median wait times for review feedback of 15-64 hours. Through an initial user study carried with 29 experts, we found that re-ordering the files changed by a patch within the review environment has potential to improve review quality, as more comments are written (+23%), and participants' file-level hot-spot precision and recall increases to 53% (+13%) and 28% (+8%), respectively, compared to the alphanumeric ordering. Hence, this paper aims to help code reviewers by predicting which files in a submitted patch need to be (1) commented, (2) revised, or (3) are hot-spots (commented or revised). To predict these tasks, we evaluate two different types of text embeddings (i.e., Bag-of-Words and Large Language Models encoding) and review process features (i.e., code size-based and history-based features). Our empirical study on three open-source and two industrial datasets shows that combining the code embedding and review process features leads to better results than the state-of-the-art approach. For all tasks, F1-scores (median of 40-62%) are significantly better than the state-of-the-art (from +1 to +9%). et.al.|[2404.10703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10703)|null|

This research paper is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of an automated approach to generate test cases specifically using Large Language Models. The methodology integrates the use of Open AI to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of test case generation for training and evaluating Large Language Models. This formalized approach with LLMs simplifies the testing process, making it more efficient and comprehensive. Leveraging natural language understanding, LLMs can intelligently formulate test cases that cover a broad range of REST API properties, ensuring comprehensive testing. The model that is developed during the research is trained using manually collected postman test cases or instances for various Rest APIs. LLMs enhance the creation of Postman test cases by automating the generation of varied and intricate test scenarios. Postman test cases offer streamlined automation, collaboration, and dynamic data handling, providing a user-friendly and efficient approach to API testing compared to traditional test cases. Thus, the model developed not only conforms to current technological standards but also holds the promise of evolving into an idea of substantial importance in future technological advancements. et.al.|[2404.10678](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10678)|null|
|**2024-04-16**|**Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning**|We explore the self-play training procedure of large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate with respect to a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to utter the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Play in this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we let LLMs act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performance uniformly improves on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLM's reasoning ability.

This typically demands a large number of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed training framework to accelerate the training. The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML had led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which begs the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient. AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator that has been purposely built for training large deep learning models. Its corresponding instance, Amazon EC2 trn1, is an alternative to GPU instances for LLM training. However, training LLMs with billions of parameters on trn1 is challenging due to its relatively nascent software ecosystem. In this paper, we showcase HLAT: a 7 billion parameter decoder-only LLM pre-trained using trn1 instances over 1.8 trillion tokens. The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular open source baseline models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been trained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. On various evaluation tasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines. We also share the best practice of using the Neuron Distributed Training Library (NDTL), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium to achieve efficient training. Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by the NDTL is able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high performance and cost-effectiveness. et.al.|[2404.10630](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10630)|null|

While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses. et.al.|[2404.10618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10618)|null|

However, current evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in common scenarios, lacking quantifiable and automated assessment in autonomous driving contexts, let alone severe road corner cases that even the state-of-the-art autonomous driving perception systems struggle to handle. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, a novel vision-language benchmark for self-driving, which provides the first automatic and quantitative evaluation of LVLMs for interpretable autonomous driving including general perception, regional perception, and driving suggestions. CODA-LM utilizes the texts to describe the road images, exploiting powerful text-only large language models (LLMs) without image inputs to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in autonomous driving scenarios, which reveals stronger alignment with human preferences than LVLM judges. Experiments demonstrate that even the closed-sourced commercial LVLMs like GPT-4V cannot deal with road corner cases well, suggesting that we are still far from a strong LVLM-powered intelligent driving agent, and we hope our CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote future development. et.al.|[2404.10595](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10595)|null|

Before tuning, we constructed Japanese financial-focused datasets for continual pre-training. As a base model, we employed a Japanese LLM that achieved state-of-the-art performance on Japanese financial benchmarks among the 10-billion-class parameter models. After continual pre-training using the datasets and the base model, the tuned model performed better than the original model on the Japanese financial benchmarks. Moreover, the outputs comparison results reveal that the tuned model's outputs tend to be better than the original model's outputs in terms of the quality and length of the answers.

This approach hinges on decomposing any given vector, matrix, or tensor into two factors. The first factor maintains a small infinity norm, while the second exhibits a similarly constrained norm when multiplied by an orthogonal matrix. Surprisingly, the entries of factors after decomposition are well-concentrated around several peaks, which allows us to efficiently replace them with corresponding centroids for quantization purposes. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed approach and rigorously evaluate our compression algorithm in the context of next-word prediction tasks and on a set of downstream tasks for text classification. Our findings demonstrate that Kashin Quantization achieves competitive or superior quality in model performance while ensuring data compression, marking a significant advancement in the field of data quantization. et.al.|[2404.09737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09737)|null|

However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning. Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact. To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning. We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores. Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance. et.al.|[2404.09717](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09717)|null|

However, it is a challenge to obtain reliable and consistent annotations regarding argument quality, as this usually requires domain-specific expertise of the annotators. Even among experts, the assessment of argument quality is often inconsistent due to the inherent subjectivity of this task. In this paper, we study the potential of using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as proxies for argument quality annotators. To assess the capability of LLMs in this regard, we analyze the agreement between model, human expert, and human novice annotators based on an established taxonomy of argument quality dimensions. Our findings highlight that LLMs can produce consistent annotations, with a moderately high agreement with human experts across most of the quality dimensions. Moreover, we show that using LLMs as additional annotators can significantly improve the agreement between annotators.

How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we make an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP). For the MHA sub-layer, we propose an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic. Furthermore, we discover that the weight matrices in MHA sub-layer have different low-rank degrees. Thus, a novel parameter allocation scheme according to the discrepancy of low-rank degrees is devised. For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method. During the pruning, we get an interesting finding that the least important 1% of parameter actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios. et.al.|[2404.09695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09695)|null|

Uncovering LLM Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection**|Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec AD and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VAD approaches. et.al.|[2404.09654](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654)|null|
|**2024-04-15**|**Bridging Vision and Language Spaces with Assignment Prediction**|This paper introduces VLAP, a novel approach that bridges pretrained vision models and large language models (LLMs) to make frozen LLMs understand the visual world. VLAP transforms the embedding space of pretrained vision models into the LLMs' word embedding space using a single linear layer for efficient and general-purpose visual and language understanding. Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. We also demonstrate the learned visual representations hold a semantic taxonomy of LLMs, making visual semantic arithmetic possible. et.al.|[2404.09632](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09632)|**[link](https://github.com/park-jungin/vlap)**|

Over the past few years, numerous neural architectures have been suggested for the VQA problem. However, achieving success in zero-shot VQA remains a challenge due to its requirement for advanced generalization and reasoning skills. This study explores the impact of incorporating image captioning as an intermediary process within the VQA pipeline. Specifically, we explore the efficacy of utilizing image captions instead of images and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to establish a zero-shot setting. Since image captioning is the most crucial step in this process, we compare the impact of state-of-the-art image captioning models on VQA performance across various question types in terms of structure and semantics. We propose a straightforward and efficient question-driven image captioning approach within this pipeline to transfer contextual information into the question-answering (QA) model. This method involves extracting keywords from the question, generating a caption for each image-question pair using the keywords, and incorporating the question-driven caption into the LLM prompt. We evaluate the efficacy of using general-purpose and question-driven image captions in the VQA pipeline.

|**2024-04-12**|**Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Training with Language Model Integration and Critical Scenario Generation**|This paper introduces CRITICAL, a novel closed-loop framework for autonomous vehicle (AV) training and testing. CRITICAL stands out for its ability to generate diverse scenarios, focusing on critical driving situations that target specific learning and performance gaps identified in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The framework achieves this by integrating real-world traffic dynamics, driving behavior analysis, surrogate safety measures, and an optional Large Language Model (LLM) component. It is proven that the establishment of a closed feedback loop between the data generation pipeline and the training process can enhance the learning rate during training, elevate overall system performance, and augment safety resilience. Our evaluations, conducted using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the HighwayEnv simulation environment, demonstrate noticeable performance improvements with the integration of critical case generation and LLM analysis, indicating CRITICAL's potential to improve the robustness of AV systems and streamline the generation of critical scenarios. This ultimately serves to hasten the development of AV agents, expand the general scope of RL training, and ameliorate validation efforts for AV safety. et.al.|[2404.08570](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08570)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs**|State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts. et.al.|[2404.08555](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08555)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**Online Safety Analysis for LLMs: a Benchmark, an Assessment, and a Path Forward**|While Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across numerous fields, their limited interpretability poses concerns regarding their safe operations from multiple aspects, e.g., truthfulness, robustness, and fairness. Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains. et.al.|[2404.08517](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08517)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**Efficient Interactive LLM Serving with Proxy Model-based Sequence Length Prediction**|Large language models (LLMs) have been driving a new wave of interactive AI applications across numerous domains. However, efficiently serving LLM inference requests is challenging due to their unpredictable execution times originating from the autoregressive nature of generative models. Existing LLM serving systems exploit first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling, suffering from head-of-line blocking issues. To address the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and enable efficient interactive LLM serving, we present a speculative shortest-job-first (SSJF) scheduler that uses a light proxy model to predict LLM output sequence lengths. Our open-source SSJF implementation does not require changes to memory management or batching strategies. Evaluations on real-world datasets and production workload traces show that SSJF reduces average job completion times by 30.5-39.6% and increases throughput by 2.2-3.6x compared to FCFS schedulers, across no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous batching settings. et.al.|[2404.08509](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08509)|**[link](https://github.com/james-qiuhaoran/llm-serving-with-proxy-models)**|

Nonetheless, there are two constraints that restrict the further application of these vLLMs: the incapability of handling multiple targets per query and the failure to identify the absence of query objects in the image. In this study, we acknowledge that the main cause of these problems is the insufficient complexity of training queries. Consequently, we define the general sequence format for complex queries. Then we incorporate a semantic segmentation task in the current pipeline to fulfill the requirements of training data. Furthermore, we present three novel strategies to effectively handle the challenges arising from the direct integration of the proposed format. The effectiveness of our model in processing complex queries is validated by the comparable results with conventional methods on both close-set and open-set semantic segmentation datasets. Additionally, we outperform a series of vLLMs in reasoning and referring segmentation, showcasing our model's remarkable capabilities.

|**2024-04-12**|**Strategic Interactions between Large Language Models-based Agents in Beauty Contests**|The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) presents substantial potential for deeper understanding of human behaviours within game theory frameworks through simulations. Leveraging on the diverse pool of LLM types and addressing the gap in research on competitive games, this paper examines the strategic interactions among multiple types of LLM-based agents in a classical game of beauty contest. Drawing parallels to experiments involving human subjects, LLM-based agents are assessed similarly in terms of strategic levels. They demonstrate varying depth of reasoning that falls within a range of level-0 and 1, and show convergence in actions in repeated settings. Furthermore, I also explore how variations in group composition of agent types influence strategic behaviours, where I found higher proportion of fixed-strategy opponents enhances convergence for LLM-based agents, and having a mixed environment with agents of differing relative strategic levels accelerates convergence for all agents. There could also be higher average payoffs for the more intelligent agents, albeit at the expense of the less intelligent agents. These results not only provide insights into outcomes for simulated agents under specified scenarios, it also offer valuable implications for understanding strategic interactions between algorithms. et.al.|[2404.08492](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08492)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models: does it work with languages other than English? A targeted test in Italian**|This paper proposes a test to perform Thematic Analysis (TA) with Large Language Model (LLM) on data which is in a different language than English. While there has been initial promising work on using pre-trained LLMs for TA on data in English, we lack any tests on whether these models can reasonably perform the same analysis with good quality in other language. In this paper a test will be proposed using an open access dataset of semi-structured interviews in Italian. The test shows that a pre-trained model can perform such a TA on the data, also using prompts in Italian. A comparative test shows the model capacity to produce themes which have a good resemblance with those produced independently by human researchers. The main implication of this study is that pre-trained LLMs may thus be suitable to support analysis in multilingual situations, so long as the language is supported by the model used. et.al.|[2404.08488](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08488)|null|

Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interactive collaboration between humans and robots. In this paper, we examine the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for inferring human intention during a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We introduce a hierarchical approach for interpreting user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions and combining them with environment states and user verbal cues captured using an existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Our evaluation demonstrates the potential of LLMs to interpret non-verbal cues and to combine them with their context-understanding capabilities and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction during human-robot interaction. et.al.|[2404.08424](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08424)|null|
|**2024-04-12**|**AdapterSwap: Continuous Training of LLMs with Data Removal and Access-Control Guarantees**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of completing knowledge intensive tasks by recalling information from a static pretraining corpus. Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion. et.al.|[2404.08417](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08417)|null|
|**2024-04-11**|**OpenBias: Open-set Bias Detection in Text-to-Image Generative Models**|Text-to-image generative models are becoming increasingly popular and accessible to the general public. As these models see large-scale deployments, it is necessary to deeply investigate their safety and fairness to not disseminate and perpetuate any kind of biases. However, existing works focus on detecting closed sets of biases defined a priori, limiting the studies to well-known concepts. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of open-set bias detection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias, a new pipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically, without access to any precompiled set. OpenBias has three stages. In the first phase, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases given a set of captions. Secondly, the target generative model produces images using the same set of captions. Lastly, a Vision Question Answering model recognizes the presence and extent of the previously proposed biases. We study the behavior of Stable Diffusion 1.5, 2, and XL emphasizing new biases, never investigated before. Via quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that OpenBias agrees with current closed-set bias detection methods and human judgement. et.al.|[2404.07990](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07990)|null|
|**2024-04-11**|**Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility**|Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries. Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.

We propose a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. We introduce LLoCO, a technique that combines context compression, retrieval, and parameter-efficient finetuning using LoRA. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up and substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering, making it a promising solution for efficient long context processing.

In this work, we unveil Ferret-v2, a significant upgrade to Ferret, with three key designs. (1) Any resolution grounding and referring: A flexible approach that effortlessly handles higher image resolution, improving the model's ability to process and understand images in greater detail. (2) Multi-granularity visual encoding: By integrating the additional DINOv2 encoder, the model learns better and diverse underlying contexts for global and fine-grained visual information. (3) A three-stage training paradigm: Besides image-caption alignment, an additional stage is proposed for high-resolution dense alignment before the final instruction tuning. Experiments show that Ferret-v2 provides substantial improvements over Ferret and other state-of-the-art methods, thanks to its high-resolution scaling and fine-grained visual processing. et.al.|[2404.07973](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07973)|null|

Collaborative human-AI labeling is a promising approach to annotating large-scale and complex data for various tasks. Yet, tools and methods to support effective human-AI collaboration for data annotation are under-studied. This gap is pertinent because co-labeling tasks need to support a two-way interactive discussion that can add nuance and context, particularly in the context of online risk, which is highly subjective and contextualized. Therefore, we provide some of the early benefits and challenges of using LLMs-based tools for risk annotation and suggest future directions for the HCI research community to leverage LLMs as research tools to facilitate human-AI collaboration in contextualized online data annotation. Our research interests align very well with the purposes of the LLMs as Research Tools workshop to identify ongoing applications and challenges of using LLMs to work with data in HCI research. We anticipate learning valuable insights from organizers and participants into how LLMs can help reshape the HCI community's methods for working with data. et.al.|[2404.07926](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07926)|null|

Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend. et.al.|[2404.07921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07921)|**[link](https://github.com/osu-nlp-group/amplegcg)**|

There is also a need for model alignment without a costly large scale human annotation effort. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional representation of human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. Trained from the value-relevant output of eight multilingual LLMs and tested on the output from four multilingual LLMs, namely LlaMA2, ChatGPT, JAIS and Yi, we show that UniVaR is a powerful tool to compare the distribution of human values embedded in different LLMs with different langauge sources. Through UniVaR, we explore how different LLMs prioritize various values in different languages and cultures, shedding light on the complex interplay between human values and language modeling. et.al.|[2404.07900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07900)|null|

To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks.

|**2024-04-10**|**Continuous Language Model Interpolation for Dynamic and Controllable Text Generation**|As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously. et.al.|[2404.07117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07117)|null|

Conventional evaluation methods, typically designed primarily for LLM development, yield numerical scores that ignore the user experience. Therefore, our study shifts the focus from model-centered to human-centered evaluation in the context of AI-powered writing assistance applications. Our proposed metric, termed ``Revision Distance,'' utilizes LLMs to suggest revision edits that mimic the human writing process. It is determined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from the generated revision edit details, our metric can provide a self-explained text evaluation result in a human-understandable manner beyond the context-independent score. Our results show that for the easy-writing task, ``Revision Distance'' is consistent with established metrics (ROUGE, Bert-score, and GPT-score), but offers more insightful, detailed feedback and better distinguishes between texts. Moreover, in the context of challenging academic writing tasks, our metric still delivers reliable evaluations where other metrics tend to struggle. Furthermore, our metric also holds significant potential for scenarios lacking reference texts. et.al.|[2404.07108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07108)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs**|Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently.

We propose a new metric to assess personality generation capability based on this evaluation method. Then, we use this personality assessment machine to evaluate dialogues in script data, resulting in a personality-dialogue dataset. Finally, we fine-tune DPG on the personality-dialogue dataset. Experiments prove that DPG's personality generation capability is stronger after fine-tuning on this dataset than traditional fine-tuning methods, surpassing prompt-based GPT-4. et.al.|[2404.07084](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07084)|null|

Previous approaches to this task have involved the design of explicit scene-encoding architectures or the incorporation of external scene-related information, such as captions. However, these methods often utilise limited contextual information or rely on intricate training pipelines. In this work, we leverage the groundbreaking capabilities of Vision-and-Large-Language Models (VLLMs) to enhance in-context emotion classification without introducing complexity to the training process in a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we propose prompting VLLMs to generate descriptions in natural language of the subject's apparent emotion relative to the visual context. In the second stage, the descriptions are used as contextual information and, along with the image input, are used to train a transformer-based architecture that fuses text and visual features before the final classification task. Our experimental results show that the text and image features have complementary information, and our fused architecture significantly outperforms the individual modalities without any complex training methods. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, namely, EMOTIC, CAER-S, and BoLD, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable accuracy across all datasets and metrics compared to much more complex approaches.

|**2024-04-10**|**Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?**|This paper studies the phenomenon that different concepts are learned in different layers of large language models, i.e. more difficult concepts are fully acquired with deeper layers. We define the difficulty of concepts by the level of abstraction, and here it is crudely categorized by factual, emotional, and inferential. Each category contains a spectrum of tasks, arranged from simple to complex. For example, within the factual dimension, tasks range from lie detection to categorizing mathematical problems. We employ a probing technique to extract representations from different layers of the model and apply these to classification tasks. Our findings reveal that models tend to efficiently classify simpler tasks, indicating that these concepts are learned in shallower layers. Conversely, more complex tasks may only be discernible at deeper layers, if at all. This paper explores the implications of these findings for our understanding of model learning processes and internal representations.

In particular, we evaluate whether every generated sentence is grounded in the retrieved documents or the model's pre-training data. Across 3 datasets and 4 model families, our findings reveal that a significant fraction of generated sentences are consistently ungrounded, even when those sentences contain correct ground-truth answers. Additionally, we examine the impacts of factors such as model size, decoding strategy, and instruction tuning on groundedness. Our results show that while larger models tend to ground their outputs more effectively, a significant portion of correct answers remains compromised by hallucinations. This study provides novel insights into the groundedness challenges in LFQA and underscores the necessity for more robust mechanisms in LLMs to mitigate the generation of ungrounded content. et.al.|[2404.07060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07060)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**A Mathematical Theory for Learning Semantic Languages by Abstract Learners**|Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the emergence of capabilities (learned skills) when the number of system parameters and the size of training data surpass certain thresholds. The exact mechanisms behind such phenomena are not fully understood and remain a topic of active research. Inspired by the skill-text bipartite graph model presented in [1] for modeling semantic language, we develop a mathematical theory to explain the emergence of learned skills, taking the learning (or training) process into account. Our approach models the learning process for skills in the skill-text bipartite graph as an iterative decoding process in Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes and Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). Using density evolution analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of learned skills when the ratio of the size of training texts to the number of skills exceeds a certain threshold. Our analysis also yields a scaling law for testing errors relative to the size of training texts. Upon completion of the training, we propose a method for semantic compression and discuss its application in semantic communication. et.al.|[2404.07009](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07009)|null|

We designed an evaluation checklist tailored to news editors' perspectives, obtained generated texts from three popular conversational models using a subset of a publicly available dataset in media bias, and evaluated the texts according to the designed checklist. Furthermore, we examined the models as evaluator for checking the quality of debiased model outputs. Our findings indicate that none of the LLMs are perfect in debiasing. Notably, some models, including ChatGPT, introduced unnecessary changes that may impact the author's style and create misinformation. Lastly, we show that the models do not perform as proficiently as domain experts in evaluating the quality of debiased outputs. et.al.|[2404.06488](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06488)|null|
|**2024-04-10**|**Ada-LEval: Evaluating long-context LLMs with length-adaptable benchmarks**|Recently, the large language model (LLM) community has shown increasing interest in enhancing LLMs' capability to handle extremely long documents. As various long-text techniques and model architectures emerge, the precise and detailed evaluation of models' long-text capabilities has become increasingly important. Existing long-text evaluation benchmarks, such as L-Eval and LongBench, construct long-text test sets based on open-source datasets, focusing mainly on QA and summarization tasks. These datasets include test samples of varying lengths (from 2k to 32k+) entangled together, making it challenging to assess model capabilities across different length ranges. Moreover, they do not cover the ultralong settings (100k+ tokens) that the latest LLMs claim to achieve. In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, a length-adaptable benchmark for evaluating the long-context understanding of LLMs. Ada-LEval includes two challenging subsets, TSort and BestAnswer, which enable a more reliable evaluation of LLMs' long context capabilities. These benchmarks support intricate manipulation of the length of test cases, and can easily produce text samples up to 128k tokens. We evaluate 4 state-of-the-art closed-source API models and 6 open-source models with Ada-LEval. The evaluation results demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs, especially in ultra-long-context settings.

|**2024-04-09**|**Automated Federated Pipeline for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models**|Recently, there has been a surge in the development of advanced intelligent generative content (AIGC), especially large language models (LLMs). However, for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using private data. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solution to LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with high computational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstream tasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computing and network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additional complexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design and implement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipe firstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions to the LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selected weight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate local adapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, it appropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space according to the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks. et.al.|[2404.06448](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06448)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**Large Language Models to the Rescue: Deadlock Resolution in Multi-Robot Systems**|Multi-agent robotic systems are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the system can get stuck away from its desired location under a smooth low-level control policy. Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, it is not possible to guarantee that just a low-level control policy can resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the possibility of using LLMs for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where an LLM resolves deadlocks by assigning a leader and direction for the leader to move along. A graph neural network (GNN) based low-level distributed control policy executes the assigned plan. We systematically study various prompting techniques to improve LLM's performance in resolving deadlocks. In particular, as part of prompt engineering, we provide in-context examples for LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments on various multi-robot environments with up to 15 agents and 40 obstacles. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based high-level planners are effective in resolving deadlocks in MRS. et.al.|[2404.06413](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06413)|null|
|**2024-04-09**|**AgentQuest: A Modular Benchmark Framework to Measure Progress and Improve LLM Agents**|The advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the pursuit of LLM agents that can solve intricate, multi-step reasoning tasks. As with any research pursuit, benchmarking and evaluation are key corner stones to efficient and reliable progress. However, existing benchmarks are often narrow and simply compute overall task success. To face these issues, we propose AgentQuest -- a framework where (i) both benchmarks and metrics are modular and easily extensible through well documented and easy-to-use APIs; (ii) we offer two new evaluation metrics that can reliably track LLM agent progress while solving a task. We exemplify the utility of the metrics on two use cases wherein we identify common failure points and refine the agent architecture to obtain a significant performance increase. Together with the research community, we hope to extend AgentQuest further and therefore we make it available under https://github.com/nec-research/agentquest. et.al.|[2404.06411](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06411)|**[link](https://github.com/nec-research/agentquest)**|
|**2024-04-09**|**Take a Look at it! Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak**|Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not.   In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model. et.al.|[2404.06407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06407)|**[link](https://github.com/controllability/jailbreak-evaluation)**|

This scenario underscores the importance of exploring the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a resource-efficient alternative. In this context, we introduce MiniCPM, specifically the 1.2B and 2.4B non-embedding parameter variants, not only excel in their respective categories but also demonstrate capabilities on par with 7B-13B LLMs. While focusing on SLMs, our approach exhibits scalability in both model and data dimensions for future LLM research. Regarding model scaling, we employ extensive model wind tunnel experiments for stable and optimal scaling. For data scaling, we introduce a Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler (LRS), conducive to continuous training and domain adaptation. We present an in-depth analysis of the intriguing training dynamics that occurred in the WSD LRS. With WSD LRS, we are now able to efficiently study data-model scaling law without extensive retraining experiments on both axes of model and data, from which we derive the much higher compute optimal data-model ratio than Chinchilla Optimal. Additionally, we introduce MiniCPM family, including MiniCPM-DPO, MiniCPM-MoE and MiniCPM-128K, whose excellent performance further cementing MiniCPM's foundation in diverse SLM applications.

While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is well-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible with ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths, thereby enhancing the model's performance in musical composition. To address the challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during generation, we propose the development of a \underline{S}ynchronized \underline{M}ulti-\underline{T}rack ABC Notation (\textbf{SMT-ABC Notation}), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple musical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of handling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90\% of the symbolic music data in our training set. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the \underline{S}ymbolic \underline{M}usic \underline{S}caling Law (\textbf{SMS Law}) on model performance.

|**2024-04-09**|**Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training for Large Language Models**|Ensuring alignment with human preferences is a crucial characteristic of large language models (LLMs). Presently, the primary alignment methods, RLHF and DPO, require extensive human annotation, which is expensive despite their efficacy. The significant expenses associated with current alignment techniques motivate researchers to investigate the development of annotation-free alignment training methods. In pursuit of improved alignment without relying on external annotation, we introduce Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training (LD-Align). This approach seeks to align the model with a high-quality supervised fine-tune dataset using guidance from a latent space. The latent space is generated through sample reconstruction, akin to auto-encoding. Consequently, we utilize the distance between sample pairs in the latent space to guide DPO-based alignment training. Extensive experimentation and evaluation show the efficacy of our proposed method in achieving notable alignment. et.al.|[2404.06390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06390)|null|

However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

|**2024-04-08**|**Ferret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding with Multimodal LLMs**|Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks. et.al.|[2404.05719](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05719)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Beyond Accuracy**|The leaderboard of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical tasks has been continuously updated. However, the majority of evaluations focus solely on the final results, neglecting the quality of the intermediate steps. This oversight can mask underlying problems, such as logical errors or unnecessary steps in the reasoning process. To measure reasoning beyond final-answer accuracy, we introduce ReasonEval, a new methodology for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps. ReasonEval employs $\textit{validity}$ and $\textit{redundancy}$ to characterize the reasoning quality, as well as accompanying LLMs to assess them automatically. Instantiated by base models that possess strong mathematical knowledge and trained with high-quality labeled data, ReasonEval achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-labeled datasets and can accurately detect different types of errors generated by perturbation. When applied to evaluate LLMs specialized in math, we find that an increase in final-answer accuracy does not necessarily guarantee an improvement in the overall quality of the reasoning steps for challenging mathematical problems. Additionally, we observe that ReasonEval can play a significant role in data selection. We release the best-performing model, meta-evaluation script, and all evaluation results at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ReasonEval. et.al.|[2404.05692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05692)|**[link](https://github.com/gair-nlp/reasoneval)**|

Previous approaches improve the generalization ability to expand the knowledge of the detector, using 'positive' pseudo-labels with additional 'class' names, e.g., sock, iPod, and alligator. To extend the previous methods in two aspects, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Losses and visual Features (RALF). Our method retrieves related 'negative' classes and augments loss functions. Also, visual features are augmented with 'verbalized concepts' of classes, e.g., worn on the feet, handheld music player, and sharp teeth. Specifically, RALF consists of two modules: Retrieval Augmented Losses (RAL) and Retrieval-Augmented visual Features (RAF). RAL constitutes two losses reflecting the semantic similarity with negative vocabularies. In addition, RAF augments visual features with the verbalized concepts from a large language model (LLM). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RALF on COCO and LVIS benchmark datasets. We achieve improvement up to 3.4 box AP $_{50}^{\text{N}}$ on novel categories of the COCO dataset and 3.6 mask AP$_{\text{r}}$ gains on the LVIS dataset.

As foundational text-to-image models rapidly evolve, the demand for robust image-to-image translation grows. Addressing this need, MoMA specializes in subject-driven personalized image generation. Utilizing an open-source, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), we train MoMA to serve a dual role as both a feature extractor and a generator. This approach effectively synergizes reference image and text prompt information to produce valuable image features, facilitating an image diffusion model. To better leverage the generated features, we further introduce a novel self-attention shortcut method that efficiently transfers image features to an image diffusion model, improving the resemblance of the target object in generated images. Remarkably, as a tuning-free plug-and-play module, our model requires only a single reference image and outperforms existing methods in generating images with high detail fidelity, enhanced identity-preservation and prompt faithfulness. Our work is open-source, thereby providing universal access to these advancements. et.al.|[2404.05674](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674)|null|
|**2024-04-08**|**CoReS: Orchestrating the Dance of Reasoning and Segmentation**|The reasoning segmentation task, which demands a nuanced comprehension of intricate queries to accurately pinpoint object regions, is attracting increasing attention. However, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) often find it difficult to accurately localize the objects described in complex reasoning contexts. We believe that the act of reasoning segmentation should mirror the cognitive stages of human visual search, where each step is a progressive refinement of thought toward the final object. Thus we introduce the Chains of Reasoning and Segmenting (CoReS) and find this top-down visual hierarchy indeed enhances the visual search process. Specifically, we propose a dual-chain structure that generates multi-modal, chain-like outputs to aid the segmentation process. Furthermore, to steer the MLLM's outputs into this intended hierarchy, we incorporate in-context inputs as guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our CoReS, which surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 7.1\% on the ReasonSeg dataset.

However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages. et.al.|[2404.05590](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05590)|null|

|**2024-04-05**|**Chinese Tiny LLM: Pretraining a Chinese-Centric Large Language Model**|In this study, we introduce CT-LLM, a 2B large language model (LLM) that illustrates a pivotal shift towards prioritizing the Chinese language in developing LLMs. Uniquely initiated from scratch, CT-LLM diverges from the conventional methodology by primarily incorporating Chinese textual data, utilizing an extensive corpus of 1,200 billion tokens, including 800 billion Chinese tokens, 300 billion English tokens, and 100 billion code tokens. This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models. et.al.|[2404.04167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04167)|null|
|**2024-04-05**|**Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge**|Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method. et.al.|[2404.04108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108)|**[link](https://github.com/chistera4-expectation/knowledge-graphs)**|
|**2024-04-05**|**Robust Preference Optimization with Provable Noise Tolerance for LLMs**|The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators' preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods. et.al.|[2404.04102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04102)|null|
|**2024-04-05**|**Assessing the quality of information extraction**|Advances in large language models have notably enhanced the efficiency of information extraction from unstructured and semi-structured data sources. As these technologies become integral to various applications, establishing an objective measure for the quality of information extraction becomes imperative. However, the scarcity of labeled data presents significant challenges to this endeavor. In this paper, we introduce an automatic framework to assess the quality of the information extraction and its completeness. The framework focuses on information extraction in the form of entity and its properties. We discuss how to handle the input/output size limitations of the large language models and analyze their performance when iteratively extracting the information. Finally, we introduce metrics to evaluate the quality of the extraction and provide an extensive discussion on how to interpret the metrics. et.al.|[2404.04068](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04068)|null|
|**2024-04-05**|**CLUE: A Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation for LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. However, evaluation of these models has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. Additionally, there has been no thorough comparison between biomedical and general-domain LLMs for clinical tasks. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on real-world clinical tasks. CLUE includes two novel datasets derived from MIMIC IV discharge letters and four existing tasks designed to test the practical applicability of LLMs in healthcare settings. Our evaluation covers several biomedical and general domain LLMs, providing insights into their clinical performance and applicability. CLUE represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application.

|**2024-04-05**|**VoicePilot: Harnessing LLMs as Speech Interfaces for Physically Assistive Robots**|Physically assistive robots present an opportunity to significantly increase the well-being and independence of individuals with motor impairments or other forms of disability who are unable to complete activities of daily living. Speech interfaces, especially ones that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), can enable individuals to effectively and naturally communicate high-level commands and nuanced preferences to robots. Frameworks for integrating LLMs as interfaces to robots for high level task planning and code generation have been proposed, but fail to incorporate human-centric considerations which are essential while developing assistive interfaces. In this work, we present a framework for incorporating LLMs as speech interfaces for physically assistive robots, constructed iteratively with 3 stages of testing involving a feeding robot, culminating in an evaluation with 11 older adults at an independent living facility. We use both quantitative and qualitative data from the final study to validate our framework and additionally provide design guidelines for using LLMs as speech interfaces for assistive robots.

|**2024-04-05**|**A Comparison of Methods for Evaluating Generative IR**|Information retrieval systems increasingly incorporate generative components. For example, in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, a retrieval component might provide a source of ground truth, while a generative component summarizes and augments its responses. In other systems, a large language model (LLM) might directly generate responses without consulting a retrieval component. While there are multiple definitions of generative information retrieval (Gen-IR) systems, in this paper we focus on those systems where the system's response is not drawn from a fixed collection of documents or passages. The response to a query may be entirely new text never. Since traditional IR evaluation methods break down under this model, we explore various methods that extend traditional offline evaluation approaches to the Gen-IR context. Offline IR evaluation traditionally employs paid human assessors, but increasingly LLMs are replacing human assessment, demonstrating capabilities similar or superior to crowdsourced labels. Given that Gen-IR systems do not generate responses from a fixed set, we assume that methods for Gen-IR evaluation must largely depend on LLM-generated labels. Along with methods based on binary and graded relevance, we explore methods based on explicit subtopics, pairwise preferences, and embeddings. We first validate these methods against human assessments on several TREC Deep Learning Track tasks; we then apply these methods to evaluate the output of several purely generative systems. For each method we consider both its ability to act autonomously, without the need for human labels or other input, and its ability to support human auditing. To trust these methods, we must be assured that their results align with human assessments. In order to do so, evaluation criteria must be transparent, so that outcomes can be audited by human assessors. et.al.|[2404.04044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04044)|**[link](https://github.com/narabzad/genir-evaluation)**|
|**2024-04-04**|**OpenNeRF: Open Set 3D Neural Scene Segmentation with Pixel-Wise Features and Rendered Novel Views**|Large visual-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, enable open-set image segmentation to segment arbitrary concepts from an image in a zero-shot manner. This goes beyond the traditional closed-set assumption, i.e., where models can only segment classes from a pre-defined training set. More recently, first works on open-set segmentation in 3D scenes have appeared in the literature. These methods are heavily influenced by closed-set 3D convolutional approaches that process point clouds or polygon meshes. However, these 3D scene representations do not align well with the image-based nature of the visual-language models. Indeed, point cloud and 3D meshes typically have a lower resolution than images and the reconstructed 3D scene geometry might not project well to the underlying 2D image sequences used to compute pixel-aligned CLIP features. To address these challenges, we propose OpenNeRF which naturally operates on posed images and directly encodes the VLM features within the NeRF. This is similar in spirit to LERF, however our work shows that using pixel-wise VLM features (instead of global CLIP features) results in an overall less complex architecture without the need for additional DINO regularization. Our OpenNeRF further leverages NeRF's ability to render novel views and extract open-set VLM features from areas that are not well observed in the initial posed images. For 3D point cloud segmentation on the Replica dataset, OpenNeRF outperforms recent open-vocabulary methods such as LERF and OpenScene by at least +4.9 mIoU. et.al.|[2404.03650](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03650)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**AutoWebGLM: Bootstrap And Reinforce A Large Language Model-based Web Navigating Agent**|Large language models (LLMs) have fueled many intelligent agent tasks, such as web navigation -- but most existing agents perform far from satisfying in real-world webpages due to three factors: (1) the versatility of actions on webpages, (2) HTML text exceeding model processing capacity, and (3) the complexity of decision-making due to the open-domain nature of web. In light of the challenge, we develop AutoWebGLM, a GPT-4-outperforming automated web navigation agent built upon ChatGLM3-6B. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages, preserving vital information succinctly. We employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training. Then, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself. For testing, we establish a bilingual benchmark -- AutoWebBench -- for real-world web browsing tasks. We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, revealing its improvements but also underlying challenges to tackle real environments.

Controls provides an interesting case study for LLM reasoning due to its combination of mathematical theory and engineering design. We introduce ControlBench, a benchmark dataset tailored to reflect the breadth, depth, and complexity of classical control design. We use this dataset to study and evaluate the problem-solving abilities of these LLMs in the context of control engineering. We present evaluations conducted by a panel of human experts, providing insights into the accuracy, reasoning, and explanatory prowess of LLMs in control engineering. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each LLM in the context of classical control, and our results imply that Claude 3 Opus has become the state-of-the-art LLM for solving undergraduate control problems. Our study serves as an initial step towards the broader goal of employing artificial general intelligence in control engineering. et.al.|[2404.03647](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03647)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text**|In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers. et.al.|[2404.03626](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Temporal Knowledge Graph**|Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of common factual knowledge information. However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model's factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. et.al.|[2404.03623](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03623)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as \textbf{the Mind's Eye}, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (\textbf{VoT}) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate \textit{mental images} to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. et.al.|[2404.03622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03622)|null|
|**2024-04-04**|**DeViDe: Faceted medical knowledge for improved medical vision-language pre-training**|Vision-language pre-training for chest X-rays has made significant strides, primarily by utilizing paired radiographs and radiology reports. However, existing approaches often face challenges in encoding medical knowledge effectively. While radiology reports provide insights into the current disease manifestation, medical definitions (as used by contemporary methods) tend to be overly abstract, creating a gap in knowledge. To address this, we propose DeViDe, a novel transformer-based method that leverages radiographic descriptions from the open web. These descriptions outline general visual characteristics of diseases in radiographs, and when combined with abstract definitions and radiology reports, provide a holistic snapshot of knowledge. DeViDe incorporates three key features for knowledge-augmented vision language alignment: First, a large-language model-based augmentation is employed to homogenise medical knowledge from diverse sources. Second, this knowledge is aligned with image information at various levels of granularity. Third, a novel projection layer is proposed to handle the complexity of aligning each image with multiple descriptions arising in a multi-label setting. In zero-shot settings, DeViDe performs comparably to fully supervised models on external datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on three large-scale datasets. Additionally, fine-tuning DeViDe on four downstream tasks and six segmentation tasks showcases its superior performance across data from diverse distributions. et.al.|[2404.03618](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03618)|null|

|**2024-04-04**|**Evaluating LLMs at Detecting Errors in LLM Responses**|With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial. However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.

The existing prominent metric for object hallucination, CHAIR, is limited to a fixed set of MS COCO objects and synonyms. In this work, we propose a modernized open-vocabulary metric, ALOHa, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to measure object hallucinations. Specifically, we use an LLM to extract groundable objects from a candidate caption, measure their semantic similarity to reference objects from captions and object detections, and use Hungarian matching to produce a final hallucination score. We show that ALOHa correctly identifies 13.6% more hallucinated objects than CHAIR on HAT, a new gold-standard subset of MS COCO Captions annotated for hallucinations, and 30.8% more on nocaps, where objects extend beyond MS COCO categories.

Based on ChatGLM3-32B, we conduct a series of experiments on both academic and our newly created challenging dataset, MathUserEval.

Both LLMs and optimization-based methods can extract LTL specifications from demonstrations; however, they have distinct limitations. LLMs can quickly generate solutions and incorporate human explanations, but their lack of consistency and reliability hampers their applicability in safety-critical domains. On the other hand, optimization-based methods do provide formal guarantees but cannot process natural language explanations and face scalability challenges. We present a principled approach to combining LLMs and optimization-based methods to faithfully translate human explanations and demonstrations into LTL specifications.

Like dense models, training MoEs requires answering the same question: given a training budget, what is the optimal allocation on the model size and number of tokens? We study the scaling law of MoE-based LLMs regarding the relations between the model performance, model size, dataset size, and the expert degree. Echoing previous research studying MoE in different contexts, we observe the diminishing return of increasing the number of experts, but this seems to suggest we should scale the number of experts until saturation, as the training cost would remain constant, which is problematic during inference time. We propose to amend the scaling law of MoE by introducing inference efficiency as another metric besides the validation loss. We find that MoEs with a few (4/8) experts are the most serving efficient solution under the same performance, but costs 2.5-3.5x more in training. On the other hand, training a (16/32) expert MoE much smaller (70-85%) than the loss-optimal solution, but with a larger training dataset is a promising setup under a training budget. et.al.|[2404.02852](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02852)|null|

However, it is not trivial for non-professionals to express and materialize this since it requires aligning functional and visual expectations with the constraints of physical space; this renders interior design a luxury. To make it more accessible, we present I-Design, a personalized interior designer that allows users to generate and visualize their design goals through natural language communication. I-Design starts with a team of large language model agents that engage in dialogues and logical reasoning with one another, transforming textual user input into feasible scene graph designs with relative object relationships. Subsequently, an effective placement algorithm determines optimal locations for each object within the scene. The final design is then constructed in 3D by retrieving and integrating assets from an existing object database. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation protocol that utilizes a vision-language model and complements the design pipeline. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that I-Design outperforms existing methods in delivering high-quality 3D design solutions and aligning with abstract concepts that match user input, showcasing its advantages across detailed 3D arrangement and conceptual fidelity. et.al.|[2404.02838](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02838)|null|
|**2024-04-03**|**Cherry on Top: Parameter Heterogeneity and Quantization in Large Language Models**|This paper reveals the phenomenon of parameter heterogeneity in large language models (LLMs). We find that a small subset of ``cherry'' parameters exhibit a disproportionately large influence on model performance, while the vast majority of parameters have minimal impact. This heterogeneity is found to be prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by this observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies the optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and preserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively quantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing quantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance. Notably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance compared to their 16-bit counterparts.

|**2024-04-03**|**Retrieving Examples from Memory for Retrieval Augmented Neural Machine Translation: A Systematic Comparison**|Retrieval-Augmented Neural Machine Translation (RAMT) architectures retrieve examples from memory to guide the generation process. While most works in this trend explore new ways to exploit the retrieved examples, the upstream retrieval step is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we study the effect of varying retrieval methods for several translation architectures, to better understand the interplay between these two processes. We conduct experiments in two language pairs in a multi-domain setting and consider several downstream architectures based on a standard autoregressive model, an edit-based model, and a large language model with in-context learning. Our experiments show that the choice of the retrieval technique impacts the translation scores, with variance across architectures. We also discuss the effects of increasing the number and diversity of examples, which are mostly positive across the board. et.al.|[2404.02835](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02835)|null|

|**2024-04-03**|**BAdam: A Memory Efficient Full Parameter Training Method for Large Language Models**|This work presents BAdam, an optimizer that leverages the block coordinate optimization framework with Adam as the inner solver. BAdam offers a memory efficient approach to the full parameter finetuning of large language models and reduces running time of the backward process thanks to the chain rule property. Experimentally, we apply BAdam to instruction-tune the Llama 2-7B model on the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU. The results indicate that BAdam exhibits superior convergence behavior in comparison to LoRA and LOMO. Furthermore, our downstream performance evaluation of the instruction-tuned models using the MT-bench shows that BAdam modestly surpasses LoRA and more substantially outperforms LOMO. Finally, we compare BAdam with Adam on a medium-sized task, i.e., finetuning RoBERTa-large on the SuperGLUE benchmark. The results demonstrate that BAdam is capable of narrowing the performance gap with Adam.

|**2024-04-02**|**Topic-based Watermarks for LLM-Generated Text**|Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text. Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms. In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs. The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM. Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM. Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss. et.al.|[2404.02138](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02138)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**Exploring Automated Distractor Generation for Math Multiple-choice Questions via Large Language Models**|Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable format in assessments and practices. One of the most important aspects of MCQs is the distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target common errors or misconceptions among real students. To date, the task of crafting high-quality distractors largely remains a labor and time-intensive process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited scalability. In this work, we study the task of automated distractor generation in the domain of math MCQs and explore a wide variety of large language model (LLM)-based approaches, from in-context learning to fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using a real-world math MCQ dataset and find that although LLMs can generate some mathematically valid distractors, they are less adept at anticipating common errors or misconceptions among real students. et.al.|[2404.02124](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02124)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**CLAPNQ: Cohesive Long-form Answers from Passages in Natural Questions for RAG systems**|Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular application for large language models. It is preferable that successful RAG systems provide accurate answers that are supported by being grounded in a passage without any hallucinations. While considerable work is required for building a full RAG pipeline, being able to benchmark performance is also necessary. We present ClapNQ, a benchmark Long-form Question Answering dataset for the full RAG pipeline. ClapNQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The ClapNQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, with multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous. RAG models must adapt to these properties to be successful at ClapNQ. We present baseline experiments and analysis for ClapNQ that highlight areas where there is still significant room for improvement in grounded RAG.

|**2024-04-02**|**Advancing LLM Reasoning Generalists with Preference Trees**|We introduce Eurus, a suite of large language models (LLMs) optimized for reasoning. Finetuned from Mistral-7B and CodeLlama-70B, Eurus models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. Notably, Eurus-70B beats GPT-3.5 Turbo in reasoning through a comprehensive benchmarking across 12 tests covering five tasks, and achieves a 33.3% pass@1 accuracy on LeetCode and 32.6% on TheoremQA, two challenging benchmarks, substantially outperforming existing open-source models by margins more than 13.3%. The strong performance of Eurus can be primarily attributed to UltraInteract, our newly-curated large-scale, high-quality alignment dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. UltraInteract can be used in both supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. For each instruction, it includes a preference tree consisting of (1) reasoning chains with diverse planning strategies in a unified format, (2) multi-turn interaction trajectories with the environment and the critique, and (3) pairwise data to facilitate preference learning. UltraInteract allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective which, together with UltraInteract, leads to a strong reward model. et.al.|[2404.02078](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02078)|**[link](https://github.com/openbmb/eurus)**|
|**2024-04-02**|**Digital Forgetting in Large Language Models: A Survey of Unlearning Methods**|The objective of digital forgetting is, given a model with undesirable knowledge or behavior, obtain a new model where the detected issues are no longer present. The motivations for forgetting include privacy protection, copyright protection, elimination of biases and discrimination, and prevention of harmful content generation. Effective digital forgetting has to be effective (meaning how well the new model has forgotten the undesired knowledge/behavior), retain the performance of the original model on the desirable tasks, and be scalable (in particular forgetting has to be more efficient than retraining from scratch on just the tasks/data to be retained). This survey focuses on forgetting in large language models (LLMs). We first provide background on LLMs, including their components, the types of LLMs, and their usual training pipeline. Second, we describe the motivations, types, and desired properties of digital forgetting. Third, we introduce the approaches to digital forgetting in LLMs, among which unlearning methodologies stand out as the state of the art. Fourth, we provide a detailed taxonomy of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, and we survey and compare current approaches. Fifth, we detail datasets, models and metrics used for the evaluation of forgetting, retaining and runtime. Sixth, we discuss challenges in the area. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks. et.al.|[2404.02062](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02062)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**Long-context LLMs Struggle with Long In-context Learning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens. However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios. This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification. We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction. We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks. We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window. However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically. This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences. Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence. Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved. Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs. et.al.|[2404.02060](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02060)|**[link](https://github.com/tiger-ai-lab/longiclbench)**|
|**2024-04-02**|**Deconstructing In-Context Learning: Understanding Prompts via Corruption**|The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard. These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback. In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect. Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation. Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples. Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance. However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results. Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging. In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration. We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance. We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ( $\geq$ 30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt. Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted. et.al.|[2404.02054](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02054)|**[link](https://github.com/text-machine-lab/understanding_prompts_via_corruption)**|

Recently, text detoxification methods found their applications in various task such as detoxification of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Leong et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2023) and toxic speech combating in social networks (Deng et al., 2023; Mun et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023). All these applications are extremely important to ensure safe communication in modern digital worlds. However, the previous approaches for parallel text detoxification corpora collection -- ParaDetox (Logacheva et al., 2022) and APPADIA (Atwell et al., 2022) -- were explored only in monolingual setup. In this work, we aim to extend ParaDetox pipeline to multiple languages presenting MultiParaDetox to automate parallel detoxification corpus collection for potentially any language. Then, we experiment with different text detoxification models -- from unsupervised baselines to LLMs and fine-tuned models on the presented parallel corpora -- showing the great benefit of parallel corpus presence to obtain state-of-the-art text detoxification models for any language. et.al.|[2404.02037](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02037)|null|
|**2024-04-02**|**Improving Retrieval Augmented Open-Domain Question-Answering with Vectorized Contexts**|In the era of large language models, applying techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation can better address Open-Domain Question-Answering problems. Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to covering longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder language model that effectively encodes contexts, and the encoding applies cross-attention with origin inputs. With our method, the origin language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that after fine-tuning, there is improved performance across two held-in datasets, four held-out datasets, and also in two In Context Learning settings. et.al.|[2404.02022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02022)|null|

Gecko achieves strong retrieval performance by leveraging a key idea: distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into a retriever. Our two-step distillation process begins with generating diverse, synthetic paired data using an LLM. Next, we further refine the data quality by retrieving a set of candidate passages for each query, and relabeling the positive and hard negative passages using the same LLM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the compactness of the Gecko. On the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), Gecko with 256 embedding dimensions outperforms all existing entries with 768 embedding size. Gecko with 768 embedding dimensions achieves an average score of 66.31, competing with 7x larger models and 5x higher dimensional embeddings. et.al.|[2403.20327](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20327)|null|
|**2024-03-29**|**Convolutional Prompting meets Language Models for Continual Learning**|Continual Learning (CL) enables machine learning models to learn from continuously shifting new training data in absence of data from old tasks. Recently, pretrained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL. These approaches rely on a pool of learnable prompts which can be inefficient in sharing knowledge across tasks leading to inferior performance. In addition, the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt, a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings, enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by ~3% with significantly less parameter overhead. We also perform strong ablation over various modules to disentangle the importance of different components. et.al.|[2403.20317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20317)|null|
|**2024-03-29**|**Towards Greener LLMs: Bringing Energy-Efficiency to the Forefront of LLM Inference**|With the ubiquitous use of modern large language models (LLMs) across industries, the inference serving for these models is ever expanding. Given the high compute and memory requirements of modern LLMs, more and more top-of-the-line GPUs are being deployed to serve these models. Energy availability has come to the forefront as the biggest challenge for data center expansion to serve these models. In this paper, we present the trade-offs brought up by making energy efficiency the primary goal of LLM serving under performance SLOs. We show that depending on the inputs, the model, and the service-level agreements, there are several knobs available to the LLM inference provider to use for being energy efficient. We characterize the impact of these knobs on the latency, throughput, as well as the energy. By exploring these trade-offs, we offer valuable insights into optimizing energy usage without compromising on performance, thereby paving the way for sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment in data center environments. et.al.|[2403.20306](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20306)|null|

Investigating Effective Interaction Methods in the Medical Domain**|We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist and potentially correct physicians in medical decision-making tasks. We evaluate several LLMs, including Meditron, Llama2, and Mistral, to analyze the ability of these models to interact effectively with physicians across different scenarios. We consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks, ranging from binary (yes/no) responses to long answer generation, where the answer of the model is produced after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians, challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing to more accurate decision-making. For example, when the physician is accurate 38% of the time, Mistral can produce the correct answer, improving accuracy up to 74% depending on the prompt being used, while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice. Our analysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM-generated suggestions are pertinent and useful, emphasizing the need for further research in this area. et.al.|[2403.20288](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20288)|null|
|**2024-03-29**|**LUQ: Long-text Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in a variety of NLP tasks. Despite their effectiveness, these models are prone to generate nonfactual content. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing our understanding of a model's confidence in its generated content, thereby aiding in the mitigation of nonfactual outputs. Existing research on UQ predominantly targets short text generation, typically yielding brief, word-limited responses. However, real-world applications frequently necessitate much longer responses. Our study first highlights the limitations of current UQ methods in handling long text generation. We then introduce \textsc{Luq}, a novel sampling-based UQ approach specifically designed for long text. Our findings reveal that \textsc{Luq} outperforms existing baseline methods in correlating with the model's factuality scores (negative coefficient of -0.85 observed for Gemini Pro). With \textsc{Luq} as the tool for UQ, we investigate behavior patterns of several popular LLMs' response confidence spectrum and how that interplays with the response' factuality. We identify that LLMs lack confidence in generating long text for rare facts and a factually strong model (i.e. GPT-4) tends to reject questions it is not sure about. To further improve the factual accuracy of LLM responses, we propose a method called \textsc{Luq-Ensemble} that ensembles responses from multiple models and selects the response with the least uncertainty. The ensembling method greatly improves the response factuality upon the best standalone LLM. et.al.|[2403.20279](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20279)|null|

However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level comprehension and limit interaction to textual instructions, thereby constraining their flexibility in usage and depth of response.

While benchmarks have been proposed to assess long-range abilities, existing efforts primarily considered generic tasks that are not necessarily aligned with real-world applications. In contrast, our work proposes a new benchmark for long-context LLMs focused on a practical meeting assistant scenario. In this scenario, the long contexts consist of transcripts obtained by automatic speech recognition, presenting unique challenges for LLMs due to the inherent noisiness and oral nature of such data. Our benchmark, named ELITR-Bench, augments the existing ELITR corpus' transcripts with 271 manually crafted questions and their ground-truth answers. Our experiments with recent long-context LLMs on ELITR-Bench highlight a gap between open-source and proprietary models, especially when questions are asked sequentially within a conversation.

Modeling the beliefs, preferences, and behaviors of a specific population can be useful for a variety of different applications, such as conducting simulated focus groups for new products, conducting virtual surveys, and testing behavioral interventions, especially for interventions that are expensive, impractical, or unethical. Existing work has had mixed success using LLMs to accurately model human behavior in different contexts. We benchmark and evaluate two well-known fine-tuning approaches and evaluate the resulting populations on their ability to match the preferences of real human respondents on a survey of preferences for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We evaluate our models against their ability to match population-wide statistics as well as their ability to match individual responses, and we investigate the role of temperature in controlling the trade-offs between these two.

This research endeavors to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing these predictive tasks. Despite their proficiency in comprehending natural language, LLMs fall short in dealing with structured tabular data. This limitation stems from their lacking exposure to the intricacies of tabular data during their foundational training. Our research aims to mitigate this gap by compiling a comprehensive corpus of tables annotated with instructions and executing large-scale training of Llama-2 on this enriched dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the practical application of applying the trained model to zero-shot prediction, few-shot prediction, and in-context learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, our methodology has shown significant improvements over existing benchmarks.

|**2024-03-28**|**InterDreamer: Zero-Shot Text to 3D Dynamic Human-Object Interaction**|Text-conditioned human motion generation has experienced significant advancements with diffusion models trained on extensive motion capture data and corresponding textual annotations. However, extending such success to 3D dynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges, primarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive descriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the initiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions without direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in achieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. Being unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we instead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large language model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers high-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies of low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce a world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions influence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework, InterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot manner. We apply InterDreamer to the BEHAVE and CHAIRS datasets, and our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates its capability to generate realistic and coherent interaction sequences that seamlessly align with the text directives. et.al.|[2403.19652](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19652)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**MagicLens: Self-Supervised Image Retrieval with Open-Ended Instructions**|Image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image, inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures. Recent work leverages text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However, existing work primarily focuses on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To show this, we introduce MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs). Trained on 36.7M (query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web, MagicLens achieves comparable or better results on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Remarkably, it outperforms previous SOTA but with a 50X smaller model size on multiple benchmarks. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens. et.al.|[2403.19651](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19651)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**Change-Agent: Towards Interactive Comprehensive Change Interpretation and Analysis from Change Detection and Change Captioning**|Monitoring changes in the Earth's surface is crucial for understanding natural processes and human impacts, necessitating precise and comprehensive interpretation methodologies. Remote sensing satellite imagery offers a unique perspective for monitoring these changes, leading to the emergence of remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) as a significant research focus. Current RSICI technology encompasses change detection and change captioning, each with its limitations in providing comprehensive interpretation. To address this, we propose an interactive Change-Agent which integrates a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) model as eyes and a large language model (LLM) as the brain. Our Change-Agent can follow user instructions to achieve comprehensive change interpretation and insightful analysis according to user instructions, such as change detection and change captioning, change object counting, change cause analysis, etc. Our proposed MCI model contains two branches of pixel-level change detection and semantic-level change captioning, in which multiple BI-temporal Iterative Interaction (BI3) layers utilize Local Perception Enhancement (LPE) and the Global Difference Fusion Attention (GDFA) modules to enhance the model's discriminative feature representation capabilities. To train the MCI model, we build the LEVIR-MCI dataset with change masks and captions of bi-temporal images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed change interpretation model and highlight the promising potential of our Change-Agent in facilitating comprehensive and intelligent interpretation of surface changes. We will make our dataset and codebase of the change interpretation model and Change-Agent publicly available to facilitate future research at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Change-Agent et.al.|[2403.19646](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19646)|**[link](https://github.com/chen-yang-liu/change-agent)**|
|**2024-03-28**|**Retrieval-Enhanced Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in question-answering tasks but often struggle to integrate real-time knowledge updates, leading to potentially outdated or inaccurate responses. This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with multi-hop questions since they require LLMs to update and integrate multiple knowledge pieces relevant to the questions. To tackle the problem, we propose the Retrieval-Augmented model Editing (RAE) framework tailored for multi-hop question answering. RAE first retrieves edited facts and then refines the language model through in-context learning. Specifically, our retrieval approach, based on mutual information maximization, leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs to identify chain facts that na\"ive similarity-based searches might miss. Additionally, our framework incorporates a pruning strategy to eliminate redundant information from the retrieved facts, which enhances the editing accuracy and mitigates the hallucination problem. Our framework is supported by theoretical justification for its fact retrieval efficacy. Finally, comprehensive evaluation across various LLMs validates RAE's ability in providing accurate answers with updated knowledge. et.al.|[2403.19631](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19631)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**WaterJudge: Quality-Detection Trade-off when Watermarking Large Language Models**|Watermarking generative-AI systems, such as LLMs, has gained considerable interest, driven by their enhanced capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Although current approaches have demonstrated that small, context-dependent shifts in the word distributions can be used to apply and detect watermarks, there has been little work in analyzing the impact that these perturbations have on the quality of generated texts. Balancing high detectability with minimal performance degradation is crucial in terms of selecting the appropriate watermarking setting; therefore this paper proposes a simple analysis framework where comparative assessment, a flexible NLG evaluation framework, is used to assess the quality degradation caused by a particular watermark setting. We demonstrate that our framework provides easy visualization of the quality-detection trade-off of watermark settings, enabling a simple solution to find an LLM watermark operating point that provides a well-balanced performance. This approach is applied to two different summarization systems and a translation system, enabling cross-model analysis for a task, and cross-task analysis. et.al.|[2403.19548](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19548)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**LLMs as Academic Reading Companions: Extending HCI Through Synthetic Personae**|This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) constitute promising yet underutilized academic reading companions capable of enhancing learning. We detail an exploratory study examining Claude.ai from Anthropic, an LLM-based interactive assistant that helps students comprehend complex qualitative literature content. The study compares quantitative survey data and qualitative interviews assessing outcomes between a control group and an experimental group leveraging Claude.ai over a semester across two graduate courses. Initial findings demonstrate tangible improvements in reading comprehension and engagement among participants using the AI agent versus unsupported independent study. However, there is potential for overreliance and ethical considerations that warrant continued investigation. By documenting an early integration of an LLM reading companion into an educational context, this work contributes pragmatic insights to guide development of synthetic personae supporting learning. Broader impacts compel policy and industry actions to uphold responsible design in order to maximize benefits of AI integration while prioritizing student wellbeing. et.al.|[2403.19506](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19506)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**Evolving Assembly Code in an Adversarial Environment**|In this work, we evolve assembly code for the CodeGuru competition. The competition's goal is to create a survivor -- an assembly program that runs the longest in shared memory, by resisting attacks from adversary survivors and finding their weaknesses. For evolving top-notch solvers, we specify a Backus Normal Form (BNF) for the assembly language and synthesize the code from scratch using Genetic Programming (GP). We evaluate the survivors by running CodeGuru games against human-written winning survivors. Our evolved programs found weaknesses in the programs they were trained against and utilized them. In addition, we compare our approach with a Large-Language Model, demonstrating that the latter cannot generate a survivor that can win at any competition. This work has important applications for cyber-security, as we utilize evolution to detect weaknesses in survivors. The assembly BNF is domain-independent; thus, by modifying the fitness function, it can detect code weaknesses and help fix them. Finally, the CodeGuru competition offers a novel platform for analyzing GP and code evolution in adversarial environments. To support further research in this direction, we provide a thorough qualitative analysis of the evolved survivors and the weaknesses found. et.al.|[2403.19489](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19489)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**JDocQA: Japanese Document Question Answering Dataset for Generative Language Models**|Document question answering is a task of question answering on given documents such as reports, slides, pamphlets, and websites, and it is a truly demanding task as paper and electronic forms of documents are so common in our society. This is known as a quite challenging task because it requires not only text understanding but also understanding of figures and tables, and hence visual question answering (VQA) methods are often examined in addition to textual approaches. We introduce Japanese Document Question Answering (JDocQA), a large-scale document-based QA dataset, essentially requiring both visual and textual information to answer questions, which comprises 5,504 documents in PDF format and annotated 11,600 question-and-answer instances in Japanese. Each QA instance includes references to the document pages and bounding boxes for the answer clues. We incorporate multiple categories of questions and unanswerable questions from the document for realistic question-answering applications. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our dataset with text-based large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models. Incorporating unanswerable questions in finetuning may contribute to harnessing the so-called hallucination generation. et.al.|[2403.19454](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19454)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**Mixed Preference Optimization: Reinforcement Learning with Data Selection and Better Reference Model**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to process and generate natural language. However, as they are trained on massive datasets of text, LLMs can inherit harmful biases and produce outputs that are not aligned with human values. This paper studies two main approaches to LLM alignment: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and contrastive learning-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By analyzing the stability and robustness of RLHF and DPO, we propose MPO (Mixed Preference Optimization), a novel method that mitigates the weaknesses of both approaches. Specifically, we propose a two-stage training procedure: first train DPO on an easy dataset, and then perform RLHF on a difficult set with DPO model being the reference model. Here, the easy and difficult sets are constructed by a well-trained reward model that splits response pairs into those with large gaps of reward (easy), and those with small gaps (difficult). The first stage allows us to obtain a relatively optimal policy (LLM) model quickly, whereas the second stage refines LLM with online RLHF, thus mitigating the distribution shift issue associated with DPO. Experiments are conducted on two public alignment datasets, namely HH-RLHF and TLDR, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPO, both in terms of GPT4 and human evaluation. et.al.|[2403.19443](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19443)|null|
|**2024-03-28**|**OAKINK2: A Dataset of Bimanual Hands-Object Manipulation in Complex Task Completion**|We present OAKINK2, a dataset of bimanual object manipulation tasks for complex daily activities. In pursuit of constructing the complex tasks into a structured representation, OAKINK2 introduces three level of abstraction to organize the manipulation tasks: Affordance, Primitive Task, and Complex Task. OAKINK2 features on an object-centric perspective for decoding the complex tasks, treating them as a sequence of object affordance fulfillment. The first level, Affordance, outlines the functionalities that objects in the scene can afford, the second level, Primitive Task, describes the minimal interaction units that humans interact with the object to achieve its affordance, and the third level, Complex Task, illustrates how Primitive Tasks are composed and interdependent. OAKINK2 dataset provides multi-view image streams and precise pose annotations for the human body, hands and various interacting objects. This extensive collection supports applications such as interaction reconstruction and motion synthesis. Based on the 3-level abstraction of OAKINK2, we explore a task-oriented framework for Complex Task Completion (CTC). CTC aims to generate a sequence of bimanual manipulation to achieve task objectives. Within the CTC framework, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose the complex task objectives into sequences of Primitive Tasks and have developed a Motion Fulfillment Model that generates bimanual hand motion for each Primitive Task.

|**2024-03-27**|**Mini-Gemini: Mining the Potential of Multi-modality Vision Language Models**|In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously. Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.

|**2024-03-27**|**Long-form factuality in large language models**|Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall).   Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality. et.al.|[2403.18802](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802)|**[link](https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality)**|

Such information could be of great use to robots that want to carry out high-level, temporally extended commands stated in natural language. However, the lack of real-world experience that language models have is a key limitation that makes it challenging to use them for decision-making inside a particular embodiment. This research assesses the feasibility of using LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo chatbot by OpenAI) for robotic path planning. The shortcomings of conventional approaches to managing complex environments and developing trustworthy plans for shifting environmental conditions serve as the driving force behind the research. Due to the sophisticated natural language processing abilities of LLM, the capacity to provide effective and adaptive path-planning algorithms in real-time, great accuracy, and few-shot learning capabilities, GPT-3.5-turbo is well suited for path planning in robotics. In numerous simulated scenarios, the research compares the performance of GPT-3.5-turbo with that of state-of-the-art path planners like Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and A*. We observed that GPT-3.5-turbo is able to provide real-time path planning feedback to the robot and outperforms its counterparts. This paper establishes the foundation for LLM-powered path planning for robotic systems. et.al.|[2403.18778](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18778)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**CheckEval: Robust Evaluation Framework using Large Language Model via Checklist**|We introduce CheckEval, a novel evaluation framework using Large Language Models, addressing the challenges of ambiguity and inconsistency in current evaluation methods. CheckEval addresses these challenges by dividing evaluation criteria into detailed sub-aspects and constructing a checklist of Boolean questions for each, simplifying the evaluation. This approach not only renders the process more interpretable but also significantly enhances the robustness and reliability of results by focusing on specific evaluation dimensions. Validated through a focused case study using the SummEval benchmark, CheckEval indicates a strong correlation with human judgments. Furthermore, it demonstrates a highly consistent Inter-Annotator Agreement. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CheckEval for objective, flexible, and precise evaluations. By offering a customizable and interactive framework, CheckEval sets a new standard for the use of LLMs in evaluation, responding to the evolving needs of the field and establishing a clear method for future LLM-based evaluation. et.al.|[2403.18771](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18771)|null|
|**2024-03-27**|**MLDT: Multi-Level Decomposition for Complex Long-Horizon Robotic Task Planning with Open-Source Large Language Model**|In the realm of data-driven AI technology, the application of open-source large language models (LLMs) in robotic task planning represents a significant milestone. Recent robotic task planning methods based on open-source LLMs typically leverage vast task planning datasets to enhance models' planning abilities. While these methods show promise, they struggle with complex long-horizon tasks, which require comprehending more context and generating longer action sequences. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing MLDT, theMulti-Level Decomposition Task planning method. This method innovatively decomposes tasks at the goal-level, task-level, and action-level to mitigate the challenge of complex long-horizon tasks. In order to enhance open-source LLMs' planning abilities, we introduce a goal-sensitive corpus generation method to create high-quality training data and conduct instruction tuning on the generated corpus. Since the complexity of the existing datasets is not high enough, we construct a more challenging dataset, LongTasks, to specifically evaluate planning ability on complex long-horizon tasks. We evaluate our method using various LLMs on four datasets in VirtualHome. Our results demonstrate a significant performance enhancement in robotic task planning, showcasing MLDT's effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of existing methods based on open-source LLMs as well as its practicality in complex, real-world scenarios. et.al.|[2403.18760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18760)|null|

While existing alignment approaches have seen empirical success, theoretically understanding how these methods affect model behavior remains an open question. Our work provides an initial attempt to theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of human preference alignment. We formally show how the distribution of preference datasets influences the rate of model updates and provide rigorous guarantees on the training accuracy. Our theory also reveals an intricate phenomenon where the optimization is prone to prioritizing certain behaviors with higher preference distinguishability. We empirically validate our findings on contemporary LLMs and alignment tasks, reinforcing our theoretical insights and shedding light on considerations for future alignment approaches.

This paper proposes a multimodal interactive robot (PhysicsAssistant) built on YOLOv8 object detection, cameras, speech recognition, and chatbot using LLM to provide assistance to students' physics labs. We conduct a user study on ten 8th-grade students to empirically evaluate the performance of PhysicsAssistant with a human expert. The Expert rates the assistants' responses to student queries on a 0-4 scale based on Bloom's taxonomy to provide educational support. We have compared the performance of PhysicsAssistant (YOLOv8+GPT-3.5-turbo) with GPT-4 and found that the human expert rating of both systems for factual understanding is the same. However, the rating of GPT-4 for conceptual and procedural knowledge (3 and 3.2 vs 2.2 and 2.6, respectively) is significantly higher than PhysicsAssistant (p < 0.05). However, the response time of GPT-4 is significantly higher than PhysicsAssistant (3.54 vs 1.64 sec, p < 0.05). Hence, despite the relatively lower response quality of PhysicsAssistant than GPT-4, it has shown potential for being used as a real-time lab assistant to provide timely responses and can offload teachers' labor to assist with repetitive tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build such an interactive multimodal robotic assistant for K-12 science (physics) education. et.al.|[2403.18721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18721)|null|

Afterwards, during inference, LLM activations are shifted for chosen subset of attention heads.

NL-ITI is tested on diverse multiple-choice benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, on which we report around 14% MC1 metric improvement with respect to the baseline ITI results. NL-ITI achieves also encouraging results on other testsets - on Business Ethics subdomain of MMLU, around 18% MC1 improvement over baseline LLaMA2-7B.

Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well. As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom. It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.   Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University. This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design. The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects. A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester. We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.   Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications. In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks. However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes. Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes. et.al.|[2403.18679](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18679)|null|

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation and understanding but face difficulties in code change, particularly at the repository level. To overcome these challenges, we empirically study the reason why LLMs mostly fail to resolve GitHub issues and analyze some impact factors. Motivated by the empirical findings, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework for GitHub Issue reSolution, MAGIS, consisting of four kinds of agents customized for the software evolution: Manager, Repository Custodian, Developer, and Quality Assurance Engineer agents. This framework leverages the collaboration of various agents in the planning and coding process to unlock the potential of LLMs to resolve GitHub issues. In experiments, we employ the SWE-bench benchmark to compare MAGIS with popular LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2.

Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\%$-$37\%$ in terms of MT-Bench scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains. et.al.|[2403.17919](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919)|null|

Central to the HCXAI discourse is the Social Transparency (ST) framework, which aims to make the socio-organizational context of AI systems accessible to their users. In this work, we suggest extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental health. In fact LLMs, which are remarkably capable of simulating roles and personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users' perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth 'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible development and use of LLM-based technology. et.al.|[2403.17873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17873)|null|

Existing work has mainly focused on mitigation of such errors using either humans or an automated approach. In this study, we explore the usage of large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation as a potential solution to the issue of NLP models making wrong predictions with high confidence during classification tasks. We compare the effectiveness of synthetic data generated by LLMs with that of human data obtained via the same procedure. For mitigation, humans or LLMs provide natural language characterizations of high confidence misclassifications to generate synthetic data, which are then used to extend the training set. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach on three classification tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of high confidence misclassifications present in the model, all while maintaining the same level of accuracy. Moreover, we find that the cost gap between humans and LLMs surpasses an order of magnitude, as LLMs attain human-like performance while being more scalable. et.al.|[2403.17860](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17860)|null|

At the same time, many benchmark datasets have become available for QA and MRC tasks. However, most existing large-scale benchmark datasets have been created predominantly using synchronous document collections like Wikipedia or the Web. Archival document collections, such as historical newspapers, contain valuable information from the past that is still not widely used to train large language models. To further contribute to advancing QA and MRC tasks and to overcome the limitation of previous datasets, we introduce ChroniclingAmericaQA, a large-scale dataset with 485K question-answer pairs created based on the historical newspaper collection Chronicling America. Our dataset is constructed from a subset of the Chronicling America newspaper collection spanning 120 years. One of the significant challenges for utilizing digitized historical newspaper collections is the low quality of OCR text. Therefore, to enable realistic testing of QA models, our dataset can be used in three different ways: answering questions from raw and noisy content, answering questions from cleaner, corrected version of the content, as well as answering questions from scanned images of newspaper pages.

In conversion, a word with one part of speech is placed in a non-prototypical context, where it is coerced to behave as if it had a different part of speech. However, while this process affects a large part of the English lexicon, little work has been done to establish the degree to which language models capture this type of generalization. This paper reports the first study on the behavior of large language models with reference to conversion. We design a task for testing lexical-syntactic flexibility -- the degree to which models can generalize over words in a construction with a non-prototypical part of speech. This task is situated within a natural language inference paradigm. We test the abilities of five language models -- two proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), three open-source models (Mistral 7B, Falcon 40B, and Llama 2 70B). We find that GPT-4 performs best on the task, followed by GPT-3.5, but that the open source language models are also able to perform it and that the 7B parameter Mistral displays as little difference between its baseline performance on the natural language inference task and the non-prototypical syntactic category task, as the massive GPT-4. et.al.|[2403.17856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17856)|null|

However, in terms of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their commendable performance in perception and reasoning tasks, their alignment with human values remains largely unexplored, given the complexity of defining hhh dimensions in the visual world and the difficulty in collecting relevant data that accurately mirrors real-world situations. To address this gap, we introduce Ch3Ef, a Compreh3ensive Evaluation dataset and strategy for assessing alignment with human expectations. Ch3Ef dataset contains 1002 human-annotated data samples, covering 12 domains and 46 tasks based on the hhh principle. We also present a unified evaluation strategy supporting assessment across various scenarios and different perspectives. Based on the evaluation results, we summarize over 10 key findings that deepen the understanding of MLLM capabilities, limitations, and the dynamic relationships between evaluation levels, guiding future advancements in the field. et.al.|[2403.17830](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17830)|null|

To navigate this, regulators must engage effectively with all parties, keep pace with global technology trends, conduct technical evaluations, issue licenses in a timely manner, and comply with various legal and policy frameworks.   In light of these challenges, this paper demonstrates example applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) to expedite spectrum regulatory processes. We explore various roles that LLMs can play in this context while identifying some of the challenges to address.

However, little is known about their robustness to minority subgroups defined by the labels and attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we investigate the effects of 18 different compression methods and settings on the subgroup robustness of BERT language models. We show that worst-group performance does not depend on model size alone, but also on the compression method used. Additionally, we find that model compression does not always worsen the performance on minority subgroups. Altogether, our analysis serves to further research into the subgroup robustness of model compression. et.al.|[2403.17811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17811)|**[link](https://github.com/wearepal/compression-subgroup)**|
|**2024-03-25**|**Towards Human-AI Deliberation: Design and Evaluation of LLM-Empowered Deliberative AI for AI-Assisted Decision-Making**|In AI-assisted decision-making, humans often passively review AI's suggestion and decide whether to accept or reject it as a whole. In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans' appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design. et.al.|[2403.16812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16812)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**An LLM-Based Digital Twin for Optimizing Human-in-the Loop Systems**|The increasing prevalence of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things (CPS-IoT) applications and Foundation Models are enabling new applications that leverage real-time control of the environment. For example, real-time control of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce its usage when not needed for the comfort of human occupants, hence reducing energy consumption. Collecting real-time feedback on human preferences in such human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, however, is difficult in practice. We propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of dynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this paper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors and thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the elderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated into an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which employs the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn how to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show that LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large open spaces. Besides, AitL-RL demonstrates superior performance compared to the popular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and personalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT applications. Through this case study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced Foundation Models like LLMs into CPS-IoT to enhance system adaptability and efficiency.

|**2024-03-25**|**Iterative Refinement of Project-Level Code Context for Precise Code Generation with Compiler Feedback**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation. Yet, incorporating LLM-based code generation into real-life software projects poses challenges, as the generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information. As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context. To this end, this paper puts forward a novel approach, termed ProCoder, which iteratively refines the project-level code context for precise code generation, guided by the compiler feedback. In particular, ProCoder first leverages compiler techniques to identify a mismatch between the generated code and the project's context. It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository. We integrate ProCoder with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation. Experimental results show that ProCoder significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on project context, and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines. et.al.|[2403.16792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16792)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**All Artificial, Less Intelligence: GenAI through the Lens of Formal Verification**|Modern hardware designs have grown increasingly efficient and complex. However, they are often susceptible to Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). This paper is focused on the formal verification of CWEs in a dataset of hardware designs written in SystemVerilog from Regenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We applied formal verification to categorize each hardware design as vulnerable or CWE-free. This dataset was generated by 4 different LLMs and features a unique set of designs for each of the 10 CWEs we target in our paper. We have associated the identified vulnerabilities with CWE numbers for a dataset of 60,000 generated SystemVerilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) code. It was also found that most LLMs are not aware of any hardware CWEs; hence they are usually not considered when generating the hardware code. Our study reveals that approximately 60% of the hardware designs generated by LLMs are prone to CWEs, posing potential safety and security risks. The dataset could be ideal for training LLMs and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to abstain from generating CWE-prone hardware designs. et.al.|[2403.16750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16750)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**Synapse: Learning Preferential Concepts from Visual Demonstrations**|This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

|**2024-03-25**|**Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography**|In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching. et.al.|[2403.16687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687)|null|

High-quality evidence plays a vital role in enhancing fact-checking systems and facilitating the generation of explanations that are understandable to humans. However, the provision of both sufficient and relevant evidence for explainable fact-checking systems poses a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method based on a Large Language Model to automatically retrieve and summarize evidence from the Web. Furthermore, we construct RU22Fact, a novel multilingual explainable fact-checking dataset on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 of 16K samples, each containing real-world claims, optimized evidence, and referenced explanation. To establish a baseline for our dataset, we also develop an end-to-end explainable fact-checking system to verify claims and generate explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the prospect of optimized evidence in increasing fact-checking performance and also indicate the possibility of further progress in the end-to-end claim verification and explanation generation tasks. et.al.|[2403.16662](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16662)|**[link](https://github.com/zeng-yirong/ru22fact)**|

However, a longstanding challenge in human alignment techniques based on reinforcement learning lies in their inherent complexity and difficulty in training. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective Contrastive Learning Framework for Human Alignment (CLHA) to align LLMs with human preferences directly. CLHA employs a novel rescoring strategy to evaluate the noise within the data by considering its inherent quality and dynamically adjusting the training process. Simultaneously, CLHA utilizes pairwise contrastive loss and adaptive supervised fine-tuning loss to adaptively modify the likelihood of generating responses, ensuring enhanced alignment with human preferences. Using advanced methods, CLHA surpasses other algorithms, showcasing superior performance in terms of reward model scores, automatic evaluations, and human assessments on the widely used ``\textit{Helpful and Harmless}'' dataset. et.al.|[2403.16649](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16649)|null|

Considering the extensive workload and huge risks associated with single-pilot operations, the development of a Virtual Co-Pilot (V-CoP) is expected to be a potential way to ensure aviation safety. This study proposes a V-CoP concept and explores how humans and virtual assistants can effectively collaborate. A preliminary case study is conducted to explore a critical role of V-CoP, namely automated quick procedures searching, using the multimodal large language model (LLM). The LLM-enabled V-CoP integrates the pilot instruction and real-time cockpit instrumental data to prompt applicable aviation manuals and operation procedures. The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis and effective retrieval of procedure information. The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis (90.5%) and effective retrieval of procedure information (86.5%). The proposed V-CoP is expected to provide a foundation for future virtual intelligent assistant development, improve the performance of single pilots, and reduce the risk of human errors in aviation. et.al.|[2403.16645](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16645)|null|
|**2024-03-25**|**Conversational Grounding: Annotation and Analysis of Grounding Acts and Grounding Units**|Successful conversations often rest on common understanding, where all parties are on the same page about the information being shared. This process, known as conversational grounding, is crucial for building trustworthy dialog systems that can accurately keep track of and recall the shared information. The proficiencies of an agent in grounding the conveyed information significantly contribute to building a reliable dialog system. Despite recent advancements in dialog systems, there exists a noticeable deficit in their grounding capabilities. Traum provided a framework for conversational grounding introducing Grounding Acts and Grounding Units, but substantial progress, especially in the realm of Large Language Models, remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the annotation of two dialog corpora employing Grounding Acts, Grounding Units, and a measure of their degree of grounding. We discuss our key findings during the annotation and also provide a baseline model to test the performance of current Language Models in categorizing the grounding acts of the dialogs. Our work aims to provide a useful resource for further research in making conversations with machines better understood and more reliable in natural day-to-day collaborative dialogs. et.al.|[2403.16609](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16609)|null|

|**2024-03-25**|**Can Large Language Models (or Humans) Distill Text?**|We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to distill text: to remove the textual traces of an undesired forbidden variable. We employ a range of LLMs with varying architectures and training approaches to distill text by identifying and removing information about the target variable while preserving other relevant signals. Our findings shed light on the strengths and limitations of LLMs in addressing the distillation and provide insights into the strategies for leveraging these models in computational social science investigations involving text data. In particular, we show that in the strong test of removing sentiment, the statistical association between the processed text and sentiment is still clearly detectable to machine learning classifiers post-LLM-distillation. Furthermore, we find that human annotators also struggle to distill sentiment while preserving other semantic content. This suggests there may be limited separability between concept variables in some text contexts, highlighting limitations of methods relying on text-level transformations and also raising questions about the robustness of distillation methods that achieve statistical independence in representation space if this is difficult for human coders operating on raw text to attain. et.al.|[2403.16584](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16584)|null|

|**2024-03-25**|**Elysium: Exploring Object-level Perception in Videos via MLLM**|Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their ability to perceive objects in still images, but their application in video-related tasks, such as object tracking, remains understudied. This lack of exploration is primarily due to two key challenges. Firstly, extensive pretraining on large-scale video datasets is required to equip MLLMs with the capability to perceive objects across multiple frames and understand inter-frame relationships. Secondly, processing a large number of frames within the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs) can impose a significant computational burden. To address the first challenge, we introduce ElysiumTrack-1M, a large-scale video dataset paired with novel tasks: Referring Single Object Tracking (RSOT) and Video Referring Expression Generation (Video-REG). ElysiumTrack-1M contains 1.27 million annotated video frames with corresponding object boxes and descriptions. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct training of MLLMs and propose a token-compression model T-Selector to tackle the second challenge.

|**2024-03-22**|**LLaVA-PruMerge: Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Large Multimodal Models**|Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 14.4 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

|**2024-03-22**|**Can large language models explore in-context?**|We investigate the extent to which contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in exploration, a core capability in reinforcement learning and decision making. We focus on native performance of existing LLMs, without training interventions. We deploy LLMs as agents in simple multi-armed bandit environments, specifying the environment description and interaction history entirely in-context, i.e., within the LLM prompt. We experiment with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2, using a variety of prompt designs, and find that the models do not robustly engage in exploration without substantial interventions: i) Across all of our experiments, only one configuration resulted in satisfactory exploratory behavior: GPT-4 with chain-of-thought reasoning and an externally summarized interaction history, presented as sufficient statistics; ii) All other configurations did not result in robust exploratory behavior, including those with chain-of-thought reasoning but unsummarized history. Although these findings can be interpreted positively, they suggest that external summarization -- which may not be possible in more complex settings -- is important for obtaining desirable behavior from LLM agents. We conclude that non-trivial algorithmic interventions, such as fine-tuning or dataset curation, may be required to empower LLM-based decision making agents in complex settings. et.al.|[2403.15371](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15371)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**CoLLEGe: Concept Embedding Generation for Large Language Models**|Current language models are unable to quickly learn new concepts on the fly, often requiring a more involved finetuning process to learn robustly. Prompting in-context is not robust to context distractions, and often fails to confer much information about the new concepts. Classic methods for few-shot word learning in NLP, relying on global word vectors, are less applicable to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named CoLLEGe (Concept Learning with Language Embedding Generation) to modernize few-shot concept learning. CoLLEGe is a meta-learning framework capable of generating flexible embeddings for new concepts using a small number of example sentences or definitions. Our primary meta-learning objective is simply to facilitate a language model to make next word predictions in forthcoming sentences, making it compatible with language model pretraining. We design a series of tasks to test new concept learning in challenging real-world scenarios, including new word acquisition, definition inference, and verbal reasoning, and demonstrate that our method succeeds in each setting without task-specific training. et.al.|[2403.15362](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15362)|null|

However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a minimalist qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. Instead of training data, SphNN uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to guide transformations from the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch by constructing sphere configurations as Euler diagrams, with the worst computational complexity of O(N^2). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination. et.al.|[2403.15297](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15297)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**Measuring Gender and Racial Biases in Large Language Models**|In traditional decision making processes, social biases of human decision makers can lead to unequal economic outcomes for underrepresented social groups, such as women, racial or ethnic minorities. Recently, the increasing popularity of Large language model based artificial intelligence suggests a potential transition from human to AI based decision making. How would this impact the distributional outcomes across social groups? Here we investigate the gender and racial biases of OpenAIs GPT, a widely used LLM, in a high stakes decision making setting, specifically assessing entry level job candidates from diverse social groups. Instructing GPT to score approximately 361000 resumes with randomized social identities, we find that the LLM awards higher assessment scores for female candidates with similar work experience, education, and skills, while lower scores for black male candidates with comparable qualifications. These biases may result in a 1 or 2 percentage point difference in hiring probabilities for otherwise similar candidates at a certain threshold and are consistent across various job positions and subsamples. Meanwhile, we also find stronger pro female and weaker anti black male patterns in democratic states. Our results demonstrate that this LLM based AI system has the potential to mitigate the gender bias, but it may not necessarily cure the racial bias. Further research is needed to comprehend the root causes of these outcomes and develop strategies to minimize the remaining biases in AI systems. As AI based decision making tools are increasingly employed across diverse domains, our findings underscore the necessity of understanding and addressing the potential unequal outcomes to ensure equitable outcomes across social groups. et.al.|[2403.15281](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15281)|null|

Our method capitalizes on the diverse capabilities of various LLMs to generate a wide array of ideas for template and verbalizer design. Our proposed method fully exploits the potential of LLMs for generation tasks and contributes more knowledge to our design.

|**2024-03-22**|**Imagination Augmented Generation: Learning to Imagine Richer Context for Question Answering over Large Language Models**|Retrieval-Augmented-Generation and Gener-ation-Augmented-Generation have been proposed to enhance the knowledge required for question answering over Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the former depends on external resources, and both require incorporating the explicit documents into the context, which results in longer contexts that lead to more resource consumption. Recent works indicate that LLMs have modeled rich knowledge, albeit not effectively triggered or activated. Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented framework, Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG), which simulates the human capacity to compensate for knowledge deficits while answering questions solely through imagination, without relying on external resources. Guided by IAG, we propose an imagine richer context method for question answering (IMcQA), which obtains richer context through the following two modules: explicit imagination by generating a short dummy document with long context compress and implicit imagination with HyperNetwork for generating adapter weights. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that IMcQA exhibits significant advantages in both open-domain and closed-book settings, as well as in both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution generalizations. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/IAG. et.al.|[2403.15268](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15268)|**[link](https://github.com/xnhyacinth/iag)**|

However, despite Information Retrieval (IR) models using LLMs as the backbone of their architectures, nearly all of them still only take queries as input, with no instructions. For the handful of recent models that do take instructions, it's unclear how they use them. We introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a rigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping IR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR builds off the long history of the TREC conferences: as TREC provides human annotators with instructions (also known as narratives) to determine document relevance, so should IR models be able to understand and decide relevance based on these detailed instructions. Our evaluation benchmark starts with three deeply judged TREC collections and alters the annotator instructions, re-annotating relevant documents. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow instructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate that existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them for basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However, we show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex instructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements (over 13%) after fine-tuning on our training set. et.al.|[2403.15246](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15246)|null|
|**2024-03-22**|**An Exploratory Investigation into Code License Infringements in Large Language Model Training Datasets**|Does the training of large language models potentially infringe upon code licenses? Furthermore, are there any datasets available that can be safely used for training these models without violating such licenses? In our study, we assess the current trends in the field and the importance of incorporating code into the training of large language models. Additionally, we examine publicly available datasets to see whether these models can be trained on them without the risk of legal issues in the future. To accomplish this, we compiled a list of 53 large language models trained on file-level code. We then extracted their datasets and analyzed how much they overlap with a dataset we created, consisting exclusively of strong copyleft code.   Our analysis revealed that every dataset we examined contained license inconsistencies, despite being selected based on their associated repository licenses. We analyzed a total of 514 million code files, discovering 38 million exact duplicates present in our strong copyleft dataset. Additionally, we examined 171 million file-leading comments, identifying 16 million with strong copyleft licenses and another 11 million comments that discouraged copying without explicitly mentioning a license. Based on the findings of our study, which highlights the pervasive issue of license inconsistencies in large language models trained on code, our recommendation for both researchers and the community is to prioritize the development and adoption of best practices for dataset creation and management. et.al.|[2403.15230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15230)|null|

However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning. In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project page: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io et.al.|[2403.14624](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey**|Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple application fields, enabling remarkable achievements across various tasks. However, their unprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models, often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts of computational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale and computational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them for particular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platforms constrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adapt the large models over the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to a specific task while minimizing the number of additional parameters introduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularly important when dealing with large language models with high parameter counts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in the supporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensive studies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance and computational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applications developed using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to the algorithmic perspective, we overview various real-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associated with different PEFT algorithms. This survey serves as an indispensable resource for researchers aiming to understand both the PEFT algorithm and its system implementation, offering detailed insights into recent advancements and practical applications. et.al.|[2403.14608](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608)|null|

In this work we introduce the Reliability AssesMent for Biomedical LLM Assistants (RAmBLA) framework and evaluate whether four state-of-the-art foundation LLMs can serve as reliable assistants in the biomedical domain. We identify prompt robustness, high recall, and a lack of hallucinations as necessary criteria for this use case.

Temperature sampling is a commonly used decoding strategy for LLMs' generation process. However, a fixed temperature parameter is used in most cases, which may not always be an optimal choice for balancing generation quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose an effective Entropy-based Dynamic Temperature (EDT) Sampling method, to achieve a more balanced performance in terms of both generation quality and diversity by dynamically selecting the temperature parameter. Additionally, we also show model performance and comprehensive analyses for 4 different generation benchmarks. Our experiments show that EDT significantly outperforms the existing strategies across different tasks. et.al.|[2403.14541](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14541)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**Cobra: Extending Mamba to Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Efficient Inference**|In recent years, the application of multimodal large language models (MLLM) in various fields has achieved remarkable success. However, as the foundation model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art methods, \textit{e.g.}, LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster speed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results of closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well in overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably, Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the number of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope that the proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems in MLLM.

|**2024-03-21**|**The Ethics of ChatGPT in Medicine and Healthcare: A Systematic Review on Large Language Models (LLMs)**|With the introduction of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have received enormous attention in healthcare. Despite their potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications. While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them. Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare. Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach. Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach. For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed. Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase. Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility. However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy. A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content. A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident. Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications. This involves considering diverse settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare. In addition, a critical inquiry is necessary to determine the extent to which the current experimental use of LLMs is necessary and justified. et.al.|[2403.14473](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14473)|null|
|**2024-03-21**|**Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing**|This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments to compare knowledge editing approaches with previous baselines, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit. et.al.|[2403.14472](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14472)|**[link](https://github.com/zjunlp/easyedit)**|

This remarkable display of LLM capabilities has ignited a surge in research contributions within this domain, spanning a diverse spectrum of topics. These contributions encompass advancements in neural network architecture, context length enhancements, model alignment, training datasets, benchmarking, efficiency improvements, and more. Recent years have witnessed a dynamic synergy between academia and industry, propelling the field of LLM research to new heights. A notable milestone in this journey is the introduction of ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot grounded in LLMs, which has garnered widespread societal attention. The evolving technology of LLMs has begun to reshape the landscape of the entire AI community, promising a revolutionary shift in the way we create and employ AI algorithms. Given this swift-paced technical evolution, our survey embarks on a journey to encapsulate the recent strides made in the world of LLMs. Through an exploration of the background, key discoveries, and prevailing methodologies, we offer an up-to-the-minute review of the literature.

|**2024-03-20**|**RAR: Retrieving And Ranking Augmented MLLMs for Visual Recognition**|CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) uses contrastive learning from noise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet its focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented method for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions. Our proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot image recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting. et.al.|[2403.13805](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13805)|null|
|**2024-03-20**|**Learning from Models and Data for Visual Grounding**|We introduce SynGround, a novel framework that combines data-driven learning and knowledge transfer from various large-scale pretrained models to enhance the visual grounding capabilities of a pretrained vision-and-language model. The knowledge transfer from the models initiates the generation of image descriptions through an image description generator. These descriptions serve dual purposes: they act as prompts for synthesizing images through a text-to-image generator, and as queries for synthesizing text, from which phrases are extracted using a large language model. Finally, we leverage an open-vocabulary object detector to generate synthetic bounding boxes for the synthetic images and texts. We finetune a pretrained vision-and-language model on this dataset by optimizing a mask-attention consistency objective that aligns region annotations with gradient-based model explanations. The resulting model improves the grounding capabilities of an off-the-shelf vision-and-language model. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game accuracy of ALBEF on the Flickr30k dataset from 79.38% to 87.26%, and on RefCOCO+ Test A from 69.35% to 79.06% and on RefCOCO+ Test B from 53.77% to 63.67%. et.al.|[2403.13804](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13804)|null|
|**2024-03-20**|**Reverse Training to Nurse the Reversal Curse**|Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on "A has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. We show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue. et.al.|[2403.13799](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13799)|null|

While the behavior coding task has rapidly adapted machine learning to predict patient states during the MI sessions, lacking of domain-specific knowledge and overlooking patient-therapist interactions are major challenges in developing and deploying those models in real practice. To encounter those challenges, we introduce the Chain-of-Interaction (CoI) prompting method aiming to contextualize large language models (LLMs) for psychiatric decision support by the dyadic interactions. The CoI prompting approach systematically breaks down the coding task into three key reasoning steps, extract patient engagement, learn therapist question strategies, and integrates dyadic interactions between patients and therapists. This approach enables large language models to leverage the coding scheme, patient state, and domain knowledge for patient behavioral coding. Experiments on real-world datasets can prove the effectiveness and flexibility of our prompting method with multiple state-of-the-art LLMs over existing prompting baselines. We have conducted extensive ablation analysis and demonstrate the critical role of dyadic interactions in applying LLMs for psychotherapy behavior understanding. et.al.|[2403.13786](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13786)|null|

While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. We find that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in group level. Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the influence exerted by other agents within the group. Experimental results on RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing conversational agents.

Pre-training requires vast amounts of monolingual data, which is mostly unavailable for languages other than English. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using synthetic data to address this data scarcity. We take the case of English and Indic languages and translate web-crawled monolingual documents (clean) into the target language. Then, we train language models containing 28M and 85M parameters on this translationese data (synthetic). We show that their performance on downstream natural language understanding and generative tasks is only 3.56\% poorer on NLU tasks and 1.51\% on NLG tasks than LMs pre-trained on clean data. Further, we propose the use of lightweight \textit{TinyLMs} pre-trained on clean data to filter synthetic data efficiently which significantly improves the performance of our models. We also find that LMs trained on synthetic data strongly benefit from extended pretraining on a tiny fraction (10\%) of clean data. We release the data we collected and created as a part of this work, \textit{IndicMonoDoc}, the largest collection of monolingual document-level corpora, which we hope will help bridge the gap between English and non-English performance for large language models. et.al.|[2403.13638](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13638)|null|

However, the inherent attention mechanism in its Transformer structure requires quadratic complexity and results in expensive computational overhead. Therefore, in this work, we propose VL-Mamba, a multimodal large language model based on state space models, which have been shown to have great potential for long-sequence modeling with fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. Specifically, we first replace the transformer-based backbone language model such as LLama or Vicuna with the pre-trained Mamba language model. Then, we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning and the combinations of different vision encoders and variants of pretrained Mamba language models. The extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks with competitive performance show the effectiveness of our proposed VL-Mamba and demonstrate the great potential of applying state space models for multimodal learning tasks. et.al.|[2403.13600](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13600)|null|
|**2024-03-20**|**No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query optimizer (version 1)**|Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of machine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries. However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should not be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda, a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort are saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization can be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods consistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those by the baselines. et.al.|[2403.13597](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13597)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**Dated Data: Tracing Knowledge Cutoffs in Large Language Models**|Released Large Language Models (LLMs) are often paired with a claimed knowledge cutoff date, or the dates at which training data was gathered. Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to date information. However, this statement only scratches the surface: do all resources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date? Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoff dates? In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff. This is distinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately to sub-resources and topics. We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing across versions of the data. Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often differ from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information from these models. et.al.|[2403.12958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12958)|null|

The extraction of key information from these documents provides a concise overview of a case, crucial for both legal experts and the public. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), automatic information extraction has become increasingly feasible and efficient.

We meticulously evaluated GPT-4's performance in extracting critical information with a manual verification process to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data. Our research is structured around two primary extraction tasks: the first involves a general extraction of eight key aspects that hold significance for both legal specialists and the general public, including the facts of the case, the claims made, references to legal statutes, references to precedents, general case outcomes and corresponding labels, detailed order and remedies and reasons for the decision. The second task is more focused, aimed at analysing three of those extracted features, namely facts, claims and outcomes, in order to facilitate the development of a tool capable of predicting the outcome of employment law disputes. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs like GPT-4 can obtain high accuracy in legal information extraction, highlighting the potential of LLMs in revolutionising the way legal information is processed and utilised, offering significant implications for legal research and practice. et.al.|[2403.12936](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12936)|null|

This lends to it a quality of creativity which can be empowering in the early stages of design. In seeking to understand how creative ways to address practical issues can be conceived between humans and GenAI, we conducted a rapid ideation workshop with 21 participants where they used a large language model (LLM) to brainstorm potential solutions and evaluate them. We found that the LLM produced a greater variety of ideas that were of high quality, though not necessarily of higher quality than human-generated ideas. Participants typically prompted in a straightforward manner with concise instructions. We also observed two collaborative dynamics with the LLM fulfilling a consulting role or an assisting role depending on the goals of the users. Notably, we observed an atypical anti-collaboration dynamic where participants used an antagonistic approach to prompt the LLM. et.al.|[2403.12928](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12928)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**Supporting Energy Policy Research with Large Language Models**|The recent growth in renewable energy development in the United States has been accompanied by a simultaneous surge in renewable energy siting ordinances. These zoning laws play a critical role in dictating the placement of wind and solar resources that are critical for achieving low-carbon energy futures. In this context, efficient access to and management of siting ordinance data becomes imperative. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently introduced a public wind and solar siting database to fill this need. This paper presents a method for harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of these siting ordinances from legal documents, enabling this database to maintain accurate up-to-date information in the rapidly changing energy policy landscape. A novel contribution of this research is the integration of a decision tree framework with LLMs. Our results show that this approach is 85 to 90% accurate with outputs that can be used directly in downstream quantitative modeling. We discuss opportunities to use this work to support similar large-scale policy research in the energy sector. By unlocking new efficiencies in the extraction and analysis of legal documents using LLMs, this study enables a path forward for automated large-scale energy policy research. et.al.|[2403.12924](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12924)|null|

Unlike previous approaches that solely focus on the geometric segmentation of indoor environments, our work enriches segmented maps with semantic data, including object identification and spatial relationships, to enhance robotic navigation. By leveraging LLMs, we provide a novel framework that interprets and organizes complex information about each segmented area, thereby improving the accuracy and contextual relevance of room segmentation. Furthermore, SeLRoS overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms by using a semantic evaluation method to accurately distinguish true room divisions from those erroneously generated by furniture and segmentation inaccuracies. The effectiveness of SeLRoS is verified through its application across 30 different 3D environments.

This paper presents Sprout, an innovative framework designed to address these concerns by reducing the carbon footprint of generative Large Language Model (LLM) inference services. Sprout leverages the innovative concept of "generation directives" to guide the autoregressive generation process, thereby enhancing carbon efficiency. Our proposed method meticulously balances the need for ecological sustainability with the demand for high-quality generation outcomes.

Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Visual Document Understanding are equipped with text recognition ability but lack general structure understanding abilities for text-rich document images. In this work, we emphasize the importance of structure information in Visual Document Understanding and propose the Unified Structure Learning to boost the performance of MLLMs. Our Unified Structure Learning comprises structure-aware parsing tasks and multi-grained text localization tasks across 5 domains: document, webpage, table, chart, and natural image. To better encode structure information, we design a simple and effective vision-to-text module H-Reducer, which can not only maintain the layout information but also reduce the length of visual features by merging horizontal adjacent patches through convolution, enabling the LLM to understand high-resolution images more efficiently. Furthermore, by constructing structure-aware text sequences and multi-grained pairs of texts and bounding boxes for publicly available text-rich images, we build a comprehensive training set DocStruct4M to support structure learning. Finally, we construct a small but high-quality reasoning tuning dataset DocReason25K to trigger the detailed explanation ability in the document domain. Our model DocOwl 1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 visual document understanding benchmarks, improving the SOTA performance of MLLMs with a 7B LLM by more than 10 points in 5/10 benchmarks.

However, the current landscape lacks the holistic integration of additional medical modalities, such as electrocardiograms (ECG). We present MEDBind (Medical Electronic patient recorD), which learns joint embeddings across CXR, ECG, and medical text. Using text data as the central anchor, MEDBind features tri-modality binding, delivering competitive performance in top-K retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot benchmarks against established VLPM, and the ability for CXR-to-ECG zero-shot classification and retrieval. This seamless integration is achieved through combination of contrastive loss on modality-text pairs with our proposed contrastive loss function, Edge-Modality Contrastive Loss, fostering a cohesive embedding space for CXR, ECG, and text. Finally, we demonstrate that MEDBind can improve downstream tasks by directly integrating CXR and ECG embeddings into a large-language model for multimodal prompt tuning. et.al.|[2403.12894](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12894)|null|
|**2024-03-19**|**HYDRA: A Hyper Agent for Dynamic Compositional Visual Reasoning**|Recent advances in visual reasoning (VR), particularly with the aid of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), show promise but require access to large-scale datasets and face challenges such as high computational costs and limited generalization capabilities. Compositional visual reasoning approaches have emerged as effective strategies; however, they heavily rely on the commonsense knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform planning, reasoning, or both, without considering the effect of their decisions on the visual reasoning process, which can lead to errors or failed procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce HYDRA, a multi-stage dynamic compositional visual reasoning framework designed for reliable and incrementally progressive general reasoning. HYDRA integrates three essential modules: a planner, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent serving as a cognitive controller, and a reasoner. The planner and reasoner modules utilize an LLM to generate instruction samples and executable code from the selected instruction, respectively, while the RL agent dynamically interacts with these modules, making high-level decisions on selection of the best instruction sample given information from the historical state stored through a feedback loop. This adaptable design enables HYDRA to adjust its actions based on previous feedback received during the reasoning process, leading to more reliable reasoning outputs and ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various VR tasks on four different widely-used datasets. et.al.|[2403.12884](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12884)|null|

How to integrate agent ability into general LLMs becomes a crucial and urgent problem. This paper first delivers three key observations: (1) the current agent training corpus is entangled with both formats following and agent reasoning, which significantly shifts from the distribution of its pre-training data; (2) LLMs exhibit different learning speeds on the capabilities required by agent tasks; and (3) current approaches have side-effects when improving agent abilities by introducing hallucinations. Based on the above findings, we propose Agent-FLAN to effectively Fine-tune LANguage models for Agents. Through careful decomposition and redesign of the training corpus, Agent-FLAN enables Llama2-7B to outperform prior best works by 3.5\% across various agent evaluation datasets. With comprehensively constructed negative samples, Agent-FLAN greatly alleviates the hallucination issues based on our established evaluation benchmark. Besides, it consistently improves the agent capability of LLMs when scaling model sizes while slightly enhancing the general capability of LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/InternLM/Agent-FLAN. et.al.|[2403.12881](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12881)|**[link](https://github.com/internlm/agent-flan)**|

However, due to the complex syntax of HDLs and the limited availability of online resources, debugging HDL codes remains a difficult and time-intensive task, even for seasoned engineers. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop automated HDL code debugging models, which can alleviate the burden on hardware engineers. Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating, completing, and debugging software code, their utilization in the specialized field of HDL debugging has been limited and, to date, has not yielded satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-assisted HDL debugging framework, namely HDLdebugger, which consists of HDL debugging data generation via a reverse engineering approach, a search engine for retrieval-augmented generation, and a retrieval-augmented LLM fine-tuning approach. Through the integration of these components, HDLdebugger can automate and streamline HDL debugging for chip design. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted on an HDL code dataset sourced from Huawei, reveal that HDLdebugger outperforms 13 cutting-edge LLM baselines, displaying exceptional effectiveness in HDL code debugging. et.al.|[2403.11671](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11671)|null|
|**2024-03-18**|**Let's Focus on Neuron: Neuron-Level Supervised Fine-tuning for Large Language Model**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are composed of neurons that exhibit various behaviors and roles, which become increasingly diversified as models scale. Recent studies have revealed that not all neurons are active across different datasets, and this sparsity correlates positively with the task-specific ability, leading to advancements in model pruning and training efficiency. Traditional fine-tuning methods engage all parameters of LLMs, which is computationally expensive and may not be necessary. In contrast, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches aim to minimize the number of trainable parameters, yet they still operate at a relatively macro scale (e.g., layer-level). We introduce Neuron-Level Fine-Tuning (NeFT), a novel approach that refines the granularity of parameter training down to the individual neuron, enabling more precise and computationally efficient model updates. The experimental results show that NeFT not only exceeded the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning and PEFT but also provided insights into the analysis of neurons. et.al.|[2403.11621](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11621)|null|

This paper introduces Linguacodus, an innovative framework designed to tackle this challenge by deploying a dynamic pipeline that iteratively transforms natural language task descriptions into code through high-level data-shaping instructions. The core of Linguacodus is a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), empowered to evaluate diverse solutions for various problems and select the most fitting one for a given task. This paper details the fine-tuning process, and sheds light on how natural language descriptions can be translated into functional code. Linguacodus represents a substantial leap towards automated code generation, effectively bridging the gap between task descriptions and executable code. It holds great promise for advancing machine learning applications across diverse domains. Additionally, we propose an algorithm capable of transforming a natural description of an ML task into code with minimal human interaction.

|**2024-03-18**|**Reinforcement Learning with Token-level Feedback for Controllable Text Generation**|To meet the requirements of real-world applications, it is essential to control generations of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has tried to introduce reinforcement learning (RL) into controllable text generation while most existing methods suffer from overfitting issues (finetuning-based methods) or semantic collapse (post-processing methods). However, current RL methods are generally guided by coarse-grained (sentence/paragraph-level) feedback, which may lead to suboptimal performance owing to semantic twists or progressions within sentences. To tackle that, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm named TOLE which formulates TOken-LEvel rewards for controllable text generation, and employs a "first-quantize-then-noise" paradigm to enhance the robustness of the RL algorithm.Furthermore, TOLE can be flexibly extended to multiple constraints with little computational expense. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve superior performance on both single-attribute and multi-attribute control tasks.

These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feed- back through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain- specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies un- derscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3.

Conventional methods tend to grapple with a lack of explainability, issuing a solitary numerical score to signify the assessment outcome. Recent advancements have sought to mitigate this limitation by incorporating large language models (LLMs) to offer more detailed error analyses, yet their applicability remains constrained, particularly in industrial contexts where comprehensive error coverage and swift detection are paramount. To alleviate these challenges, we introduce DEE, a Dual-stage Explainable Evaluation method for estimating the quality of text generation. Built upon Llama 2, DEE follows a dual-stage principle guided by stage-specific instructions to perform efficient identification of errors in generated texts in the initial stage and subsequently delves into providing comprehensive diagnostic reports in the second stage.

GE leverages LLMs for a more intelligent, supervised evolutionary process, guiding mutations and crossovers. Our unique "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique further enhances GE by enabling LLMs to reflect on and learn from the outcomes of previous mutations. This results in a self-sustaining feedback loop that augments decision-making in model evolution.

Manually pinpointing these elements, such as classes, methods, or statements, which are associated with a fault is laborious and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, various fault localization tools have been developed. These tools typically generate a ranked list of suspicious program elements. However, this information alone is insufficient. A prior study emphasized that automated fault localization should offer a rationale.   In this study, we investigate the step-by-step reasoning for explainable fault localization. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLM) in assisting developers in reasoning about code. We proposed FuseFL that utilizes several combinations of information to enhance the LLM results which are spectrum-based fault localization results, test case execution outcomes, and code description (i.e., explanation of what the given code is intended to do). We conducted our investigation using faulty code from Refactory dataset. First, we evaluate the performance of the automated fault localization. Our results demonstrate a more than 30% increase in the number of successfully localized faults at Top-1 compared to the baseline. To evaluate the explanations generated by FuseFL, we create a dataset of human explanations that provide step-by-step reasoning as to why specific lines of code are considered faulty.

|**2024-03-15**|**Optimal Block-Level Draft Verification for Accelerating Speculative Decoding**|Speculative decoding has shown to be an effective method for lossless acceleration of large language models (LLMs) during inference. In each iteration, the algorithm first uses a smaller model to draft a block of tokens. The tokens are then verified by the large model in parallel and only a subset of tokens will be kept to guarantee that the final output follows the distribution of the large model. In all of the prior speculative decoding works, the draft verification is performed token-by-token independently. In this work, we propose a better draft verification algorithm that provides additional wall-clock speedup without incurring additional computation cost and draft tokens. We first formulate the draft verification step as a block-level optimal transport problem. The block-level formulation allows us to consider a wider range of draft verification algorithms and obtain a higher number of accepted tokens in expectation in one draft block. We propose a verification algorithm that achieves the optimal accepted length for the block-level transport problem. We empirically evaluate our proposed block-level verification algorithm in a wide range of tasks and datasets, and observe consistent improvements in wall-clock speedup when compared to token-level verification algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish improvement over speculative decoding through a better draft verification algorithm. et.al.|[2403.10444](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10444)|null|

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid SLT approach, Spotter+GPT, that utilizes a sign spotter and a pretrained large language model to improve SLT performance. Our method builds upon the strengths of both components. The videos are first processed by the spotter, which is trained on a linguistic sign language dataset, to identify individual signs. These spotted signs are then passed to the powerful language model, which transforms them into coherent and contextually appropriate spoken language sentences. et.al.|[2403.10434](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10434)|null|
|**2024-03-15**|**SocialGenPod: Privacy-Friendly Generative AI Social Web Applications with Decentralised Personal Data Stores**|We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid -- a decentralised Web specification -- to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address. Our prototype is open-source and available at: https://github.com/Vidminas/socialgenpod/. et.al.|[2403.10408](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408)|**[link](https://github.com/vidminas/socialgenpod)**|
|**2024-03-15**|**A Thorough Comparison of Cross-Encoders and LLMs for Reranking SPLADE**|We present a comparative study between cross-encoder and LLMs rerankers in the context of re-ranking effective SPLADE retrievers. We conduct a large evaluation on TREC Deep Learning datasets and out-of-domain datasets such as BEIR and LoTTE. In the first set of experiments, we show how cross-encoder rerankers are hard to distinguish when it comes to re-rerank SPLADE on MS MARCO. Observations shift in the out-of-domain scenario, where both the type of model and the number of documents to re-rank have an impact on effectiveness. Then, we focus on listwise rerankers based on Large Language Models -- especially GPT-4. While GPT-4 demonstrates impressive (zero-shot) performance, we show that traditional cross-encoders remain very competitive. Overall, our findings aim to to provide a more nuanced perspective on the recent excitement surrounding LLM-based re-rankers -- by positioning them as another factor to consider in balancing effectiveness and efficiency in search systems. et.al.|[2403.10407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10407)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference**|Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for on-line key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression rates in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to ~3.7x throughput increase in auto-regressive inference on a NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. We find that DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. As a result DMC fits longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget. et.al.|[2403.09636](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09636)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**3D-VLA: A 3D Vision-Language-Action Generative World Model**|Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications. et.al.|[2403.09631](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09631)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training**|In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, consisting of both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. et.al.|[2403.09611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611)|null|

The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity, addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems. et.al.|[2403.09606](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09606)|null|

Rather than just retrieve a document, modern information retrieval systems advertise that they can synthesize an answer based on potentially many different documents, conflicting data sources, and using reasoning. We review recent literature and argue that the large language model has crucial flaws that prevent it from on its own ever constituting general intelligence, or answering general information synthesis requests. This review shows that the following are problems for large language models: hallucinations, complex reasoning, planning under uncertainty, and complex calculations. We outline how logical discrete graphical models can solve all of these problems, and outline a method of training a logical discrete model from unlabeled text. et.al.|[2403.09599](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09599)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**ExploRLLM: Guiding Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models**|In image-based robot manipulation tasks with large observation and action spaces, reinforcement learning struggles with low sample efficiency, slow training speed, and uncertain convergence. As an alternative, large pre-trained foundation models have shown promise in robotic manipulation, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot applications. However, using these models directly is unreliable due to limited reasoning capabilities and challenges in understanding physical and spatial contexts. This paper introduces ExploRLLM, a novel approach that leverages the inductive bias of foundation models (e.g. Large Language Models) to guide exploration in reinforcement learning. We also exploit these foundation models to reformulate the action and observation spaces to enhance the training efficiency in reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that guided exploration enables much quicker convergence than training without it. Additionally, we validate that ExploRLLM outperforms vanilla foundation model baselines and that the policy trained in simulation can be applied in real-world settings without additional training. et.al.|[2403.09583](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09583)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**Eyes Closed, Safety On: Protecting Multimodal LLMs via Image-to-Text Transformation**|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities, which, however, are also more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than their LLM predecessors. Although still capable of detecting unsafe responses, we observe that safety mechanisms of the pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs can be easily bypassed due to the introduction of image features. To construct robust MLLMs, we propose ECSO(Eyes Closed, Safety On), a novel training-free protecting approach that exploits the inherent safety awareness of MLLMs, and generates safer responses via adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts to activate intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs. Experiments on five state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs demonstrate that our ECSO enhances model safety significantly (e.g., a 37.6% improvement on the MM-SafetyBench (SD+OCR), and 71.3% on VLSafe for the LLaVA-1.5-7B), while consistently maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that ECSO can be used as a data engine to generate supervised-finetuning (SFT) data for MLLM alignment without extra human intervention. et.al.|[2403.09572](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09572)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Agents: An Architecture for Accountability and Explainability through Blockchain and Large Language Models**|The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios. et.al.|[2403.09567](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09567)|null|

One of these activities is "Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment" (HARA), which is an essential step to start the safety requirements specification. As a potential approach to increase the speed of this step in SafetyOps, we have delved into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).   Our objective is to systematically assess their potential for application in the field of safety engineering. To that end, we propose a framework to support a higher degree of automation of HARA with LLMs. Despite our endeavors to automate as much of the process as possible, expert review remains crucial to ensure the validity and correctness of the analysis results, with necessary modifications made accordingly. et.al.|[2403.09565](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09565)|null|
|**2024-03-14**|**Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning**|Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario. However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data. TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients. Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released. et.al.|[2403.09559](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09559)|null|
|**2024-03-13**|**Simple and Scalable Strategies to Continually Pre-train Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens, only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models, saving significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data or poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by final loss and language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between two commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English $\rightarrow$English) and a stronger distribution shift (English$\rightarrow$German) at the $405$ M parameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of tokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments, we also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be successfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies, matching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute. Finally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine learning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming and that are not bound to a fixed token budget. et.al.|[2403.08763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08763)|null|
|**2024-03-13**|**Steering LLMs Towards Unbiased Responses: A Causality-Guided Debiasing Framework**|Large language models (LLMs) can easily generate biased and discriminative responses. As LLMs tap into consequential decision-making (e.g., hiring and healthcare), it is of crucial importance to develop strategies to mitigate these biases. This paper focuses on social bias, tackling the association between demographic information and LLM outputs. We propose a causality-guided debiasing framework that utilizes causal understandings of (1) the data-generating process of the training corpus fed to LLMs, and (2) the internal reasoning process of LLM inference, to guide the design of prompts for debiasing LLM outputs through selection mechanisms. Our framework unifies existing de-biasing prompting approaches such as inhibitive instructions and in-context contrastive examples, and sheds light on new ways of debiasing by encouraging bias-free reasoning. Our strong empirical performance on real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework provides principled guidelines on debiasing LLM outputs even with only the black-box access. et.al.|[2403.08743](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08743)|null|

|**2024-03-13**|**Strengthening Multimodal Large Language Model with Bootstrapped Preference Optimization**|Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in generating responses based on visual inputs. However, they often suffer from a bias towards generating responses similar to their pretraining corpus, overshadowing the importance of visual information. We treat this bias as a "preference" for pretraining statistics, which hinders the model's grounding in visual input. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO), which conducts preference learning with datasets containing negative responses bootstrapped from the model itself. Specifically, we propose the following two strategies: 1) using distorted image inputs to the MLLM for eliciting responses that contain signified pretraining bias; 2) leveraging text-based LLM to explicitly inject erroneous but common elements into the original response. Those undesirable responses are paired with original annotated responses from the datasets to construct the preference dataset, which is subsequently utilized to perform preference learning. Our approach effectively suppresses pretrained LLM bias, enabling enhanced grounding in visual inputs. Extensive experimentation demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal conversational systems. et.al.|[2403.08730](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08730)|null|

In this work, we pivot to Reinforcement Learning (RL) -- but with a twist. Diverging from the typical RLHF, which refines LLMs following instruction data training, we use RL to directly generate the foundational instruction dataset that alone suffices for fine-tuning. Our method, TeaMs-RL, uses a suite of textual operations and rules, prioritizing the diversification of training datasets. It facilitates the generation of high-quality data without excessive reliance on external advanced models, paving the way for a single fine-tuning step and negating the need for subsequent RLHF stages. Our findings highlight key advantages of our approach: reduced need for human involvement and fewer model queries (only $5.73\%$ of WizardLM's total), along with enhanced capabilities of LLMs in crafting and comprehending complex instructions compared to strong baselines, and substantially improved model privacy protection. et.al.|[2403.08694](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08694)|null|

An innovative approach to circumvent this issue involves utilising synthetic medical records that mirror real patient data without compromising individual privacy. The creation of these synthetic datasets, particularly without using actual patient data to train Large Language Models (LLMs), presents a novel solution as gaining access to sensitive patient information to train models is also a challenge. This study assesses the capability of the Llama 2 LLM to create synthetic medical records that accurately reflect real patient information, employing zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies for comparison against fine-tuned methodologies that do require sensitive patient data during training. We focus on generating synthetic narratives for the History of Present Illness section, utilising data from the MIMIC-IV dataset for comparison. In this work introduce a novel prompting technique that leverages a chain-of-thought approach, enhancing the model's ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant medical narratives without prior fine-tuning.

|**2024-03-13**|**Human Alignment of Large Language Models through Online Preference Optimisation**|Ensuring alignment of language models' outputs with human preferences is critical to guarantee a useful, safe, and pleasant user experience. Thus, human alignment has been extensively studied recently and several methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Policy Optimisation (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) have emerged. In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we show the equivalence between two recent alignment methods, namely Identity Policy Optimisation (IPO) and Nash Mirror Descent (Nash-MD). Second, we introduce a generalisation of IPO, named IPO-MD, that leverages the regularised sampling approach proposed by Nash-MD.   This equivalence may seem surprising at first sight, since IPO is an offline method whereas Nash-MD is an online method using a preference model. However, this equivalence can be proven when we consider the online version of IPO, that is when both generations are sampled by the online policy and annotated by a trained preference model. Optimising the IPO loss with such a stream of data becomes then equivalent to finding the Nash equilibrium of the preference model through self-play. Building on this equivalence, we introduce the IPO-MD algorithm that generates data with a mixture policy (between the online and reference policy) similarly as the general Nash-MD algorithm. We compare online-IPO and IPO-MD to different online versions of existing losses on preference data such as DPO and SLiC on a summarisation task. et.al.|[2403.08635](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08635)|null|

However, their lack of domain-specific knowledge limits their applicability in healthcare settings, where contextual and comprehensive responses are vital. To address this challenge and enable the generation of patient-centric responses that are contextually relevant and comprehensive, we propose MedInsight:a novel retrieval augmented framework that augments LLM inputs (prompts) with relevant background information from multiple sources. MedInsight extracts pertinent details from the patient's medical record or consultation transcript. It then integrates information from authoritative medical textbooks and curated web resources based on the patient's health history and condition. By constructing an augmented context combining the patient's record with relevant medical knowledge, MedInsight generates enriched, patient-specific responses tailored for healthcare applications such as diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or patient education. Experiments on the MTSamples dataset validate MedInsight's effectiveness in generating contextually appropriate medical responses. Quantitative evaluation using the Ragas metric and TruLens for answer similarity and answer correctness demonstrates the model's efficacy. Furthermore, human evaluation studies involving Subject Matter Expert (SMEs) confirm MedInsight's utility, with moderate inter-rater agreement on the relevance and correctness of the generated responses. et.al.|[2403.08607](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08607)|null|

The foundational concept of our method views an image as a linguistic entity, and translates it to a set of discrete words derived from the LLM's vocabulary. To achieve this, we present the Vision-to-Language Tokenizer, abbreviated as V2T Tokenizer, which transforms an image into a ``foreign language'' with the combined aid of an encoder-decoder, the LLM vocabulary, and a CLIP model. With this innovative image encoding, the LLM gains the ability not only for visual comprehension but also for image denoising and restoration in an auto-regressive fashion-crucially, without any fine-tuning.

Through a comprehensive evaluation of 24 models across 11 benchmarks, we highlight several potential drawbacks of MCQA, for instance, the inconsistency between the MCQA evaluation and the generation of open-ended responses in practical scenarios. In response, we introduce an RWQ-Elo rating system, engaging 24 LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Google-Gemini-Pro and LLaMA-1/-2, in a two-player competitive format, with GPT-4 serving as the judge. Each LLM receives an Elo rating thereafter. This system is designed to mirror real-world usage, and for this purpose, we have compiled a new benchmark called ``Real-world questions'' (RWQ), comprising 20,772 authentic user inquiries.

While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a common safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack consistently bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time. Furthermore, we find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures or using less popular programming languages. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs. et.al.|[2403.07865](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07865)|null|

We leverage LLMs' common sense physical reasoning and code-writing abilities to infer an object's physical characteristics--mass $m$, friction coefficient $\mu$, and spring constant $k$ --from a semantic description, and then translate those characteristics into an executable adaptive grasp policy. Using a current-controllable, two-finger gripper with a built-in depth camera, we demonstrate that LLM-generated, physically-grounded grasp policies outperform traditional grasp policies on a custom benchmark of 12 delicate and deformable items including food, produce, toys, and other everyday items, spanning two orders of magnitude in mass and required pick-up force. We also demonstrate how compliance feedback from DeliGrasp policies can aid in downstream tasks such as measuring produce ripeness.

|**2024-03-12**|**The Missing Piece in Model Editing: A Deep Dive into the Hidden Damage Brought By Model Editing**|Large Language Models have revolutionized numerous tasks with their remarkable efficacy.However, the editing of these models, crucial for rectifying outdated or erroneous information, often leads to a complex issue known as the ripple effect in the hidden space. This effect, while difficult to detect, can significantly impede the efficacy of model editing tasks and deteriorate model performance.This paper addresses this scientific challenge by proposing a novel evaluation methodology, Graphical Outlier Relation based Assessment(GORA), which quantitatively evaluates the adaptations of the model and the subsequent impact of editing. Furthermore, we introduce the Selective Outlier Re-Editing Approach(SORA), a model editing method designed to mitigate this ripple effect. Our comprehensive evaluations reveal that the ripple effect in the hidden space is a significant issue in all current model editing methods. However, our proposed methods, GORA and SORA, effectively identify and alleviate this issue, respectively, contributing to the advancement of LLM editing techniques. et.al.|[2403.07825](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07825)|null|
|**2024-03-12**|**Branch-Train-MiX: Mixing Expert LLMs into a Mixture-of-Experts LLM**|We investigate efficient methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) to possess capabilities in multiple specialized domains, such as coding, math reasoning and world knowledge. Our method, named Branch-Train-MiX (BTX), starts from a seed model, which is branched to train experts in embarrassingly parallel fashion with high throughput and reduced communication cost. After individual experts are asynchronously trained, BTX brings together their feedforward parameters as experts in Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) layers and averages the remaining parameters, followed by an MoE-finetuning stage to learn token-level routing. BTX generalizes two special cases, the Branch-Train-Merge method, which does not have the MoE finetuning stage to learn routing, and sparse upcycling, which omits the stage of training experts asynchronously. Compared to alternative approaches, BTX achieves the best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. et.al.|[2403.07816](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07816)|null|
|**2024-03-12**|**Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Sequential Instructions**|Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow a sequence of instructions in a single query as they may ignore or misinterpret part of it. This impairs their performance in complex problems whose solution requires multiple intermediate steps, such as multilingual (translate then answer) and multimodal (caption then answer) tasks. We empirically verify this with open-source LLMs as large as LLaMA-2 70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Targeting the scarcity of sequential instructions in present-day data, we propose sequential instruction tuning, a simple yet effective strategy to automatically augment instruction tuning data and equip LLMs with the ability to execute multiple sequential instructions. After exploring interleaving instructions in existing datasets, such as Alpaca, with a wide range of intermediate tasks, we find that sequential instruction-tuned models consistently outperform the conventional instruction-tuned baselines in downstream tasks involving reasoning, multilingual, and multimodal abilities. To shed further light on our technique, we analyse how adversarial intermediate texts, unseen tasks, prompt verbalization, number of tasks, and prompt length affect SIT. We hope that this method will open new research avenues on instruction tuning for complex tasks. et.al.|[2403.07794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07794)|**[link](https://github.com/hanxuhu/seq_it)**|

Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM. et.al.|[2403.07769](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07769)|**[link](https://github.com/carlosxcruzcode/compet_colab_sma_llm)**|

We propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation models to create synthetic image-text pairs for efficient and effective VLM training. Our method employs pretraining a text-to-image model to synthesize image embeddings starting from captions generated by an LLM. These synthetic pairs are then used to train a VLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VLM trained with synthetic data exhibits comparable performance on image captioning, while requiring a fraction of the data used by models trained solely on human-annotated data. In particular, we outperform the baseline by 17% through augmentation with a synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we show that synthesizing in the image embedding space is 25% faster than in the pixel space. This research introduces a promising technique for generating large-scale, customizable image datasets, leading to enhanced VLM performance and wider applicability across various domains, all with improved data efficiency and resource utilization. et.al.|[2403.07750](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07750)|null|

In pursuit of this objective, we propose FineMath in this paper, a fine-grained mathematical evaluation benchmark dataset for assessing Chinese LLMs. FineMath is created to cover the major key mathematical concepts taught in elementary school math, which are further divided into 17 categories of math word problems, enabling in-depth analysis of mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs. All the 17 categories of math word problems are manually annotated with their difficulty levels according to the number of reasoning steps required to solve these problems. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs on FineMath and find that there is still considerable room for improvements in terms of mathematical reasoning capability of Chinese LLMs. We also carry out an in-depth analysis on the evaluation process and methods that have been overlooked previously. These two factors significantly influence the model results and our understanding of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available soon. et.al.|[2403.07747](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07747)|null|
|**2024-03-11**|**Hybrid Human-LLM Corpus Construction and LLM Evaluation for Rare Linguistic Phenomena**|Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs) are one of the most well-studied construction groups, providing a unique opportunity to demonstrate the usefulness of Construction Grammar (CxG). For example, the caused-motion construction (CMC, ``She sneezed the foam off her cappuccino'') demonstrates that constructions must carry meaning, otherwise the fact that ``sneeze'' in this context causes movement cannot be explained. We form the hypothesis that this remains challenging even for state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), for which we devise a test based on substituting the verb with a prototypical motion verb. To be able to perform this test at statistically significant scale, in the absence of adequate CxG corpora, we develop a novel pipeline of NLP-assisted collection of linguistically annotated text. We show how dependency parsing and GPT-3.5 can be used to significantly reduce annotation cost and thus enable the annotation of rare phenomena at scale. We then evaluate GPT, Gemini, Llama2 and Mistral models for their understanding of the CMC using the newly collected corpus. We find that all models struggle with understanding the motion component that the CMC adds to a sentence. et.al.|[2403.06965](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06965)|null|
|**2024-03-11**|**Materials science in the era of large language models: a perspective**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research, arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage these tools in their own research. et.al.|[2403.06949](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06949)|null|
|**2024-03-11**|**Naming, Describing, and Quantifying Visual Objects in Humans and LLMs**|While human speakers use a variety of different expressions when describing the same object in an image, giving rise to a distribution of plausible labels driven by pragmatic constraints, the extent to which current Vision \& Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) can mimic this crucial feature of language use is an open question. This applies to common, everyday objects, but it is particularly interesting for uncommon or novel objects for which a category label may be lacking or fuzzy. Furthermore, humans show clear production preferences for highly context-sensitive expressions, such as the quantifiers `few' or `most'. In our work, we evaluate VLLMs (FROMAGe, BLIP-2, LLaVA) on three categories (nouns, attributes, and quantifiers) where humans show great subjective variability concerning the distribution over plausible labels, using datasets and resources mostly under-explored in previous work. Our results reveal mixed evidence on the ability of VLLMs to capture human naming preferences, with all models failing in tasks that require high-level reasoning such as assigning quantifiers. et.al.|[2403.06935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06935)|null|

These challenges arise from the presence of implicit relationships that demand multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ERA-CoT, which aids LLMs in understanding context by capturing relationships between entities and supports the reasoning of diverse tasks through Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Experimental results show that ERA-CoT demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current CoT prompting methods, achieving a significant improvement of an average of 5.1\% on GPT3.5 compared to previous SOTA baselines. Our analysis indicates that ERA-CoT increases the LLM's understanding of entity relationships, significantly improves the accuracy of question answering, and enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. et.al.|[2403.06932](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06932)|**[link](https://github.com/oceanntwt/era-cot)**|
|**2024-03-11**|**MEND: Meta dEmonstratioN Distillation for Efficient and Effective In-Context Learning**|Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, where a LLM makes predictions for a given test input together with a few input-output pairs (demonstrations). Nevertheless, the inclusion of demonstrations leads to a quadratic increase in the computational overhead of the self-attention mechanism. Existing solutions attempt to distill lengthy demonstrations into compact vectors. However, they often require task-specific retraining or compromise LLM's in-context learning performance. To mitigate these challenges, we present Meta dEmonstratioN Distillation (MEND), where a language model learns to distill any lengthy demonstrations into vectors without retraining for a new downstream task. We exploit the knowledge distillation to enhance alignment between MEND and LLM, achieving both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously. MEND is endowed with the meta-knowledge of distilling demonstrations through a two-stage training process, which includes meta-distillation pretraining and fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across seven diverse ICL task partitions using decoder-only (GPT-2) and encoder-decoder (T5) attest to MEND's prowess. It not only matches but often outperforms the Vanilla ICL as well as other state-of-the-art distillation models, while significantly reducing the computational demands. This innovation promises enhanced scalability and efficiency for the practical deployment of large language models et.al.|[2403.06914](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06914)|null|
|**2024-03-11**|**Exploring Large Language Models and Hierarchical Frameworks for Classification of Large Unstructured Legal Documents**|Legal judgment prediction suffers from the problem of long case documents exceeding tens of thousands of words, in general, and having a non-uniform structure. Predicting judgments from such documents becomes a challenging task, more so on documents with no structural annotation. We explore the classification of these large legal documents and their lack of structural information with a deep-learning-based hierarchical framework which we call MESc; "Multi-stage Encoder-based Supervised with-clustering"; for judgment prediction. Specifically, we divide a document into parts to extract their embeddings from the last four layers of a custom fine-tuned Large Language Model, and try to approximate their structure through unsupervised clustering. Which we use in another set of transformer encoder layers to learn the inter-chunk representations. We analyze the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-billion parameters (GPT-Neo, and GPT-J) with the hierarchical framework of MESc and compare them with their standalone performance on legal texts. We also study their intra-domain(legal) transfer learning capability and the impact of combining embeddings from their last layers in MESc. We test these methods and their effectiveness with extensive experiments and ablation studies on legal documents from India, the European Union, and the United States with the ILDC dataset and a subset of the LexGLUE dataset. Our approach achieves a minimum total performance gain of approximately 2 points over previous state-of-the-art methods. et.al.|[2403.06872](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06872)|null|
|**2024-03-11**|**Development of a Reliable and Accessible Caregiving Language Model (CaLM)**|Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training. Because of this, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care. Large language models can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers as educational tools or as adjunct to care. This study aimed to develop a reliable Caregiving Language Model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and evaluate the performance of the model compared to a large FM. We developed CaLM using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. We used two small FMs as candidates for the FM of CaLM (LLaMA-2 and Falcon with 7B parameters) and larger FM GPT-3.5 as a benchmark. We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the Internet. In this study, we focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias. We evaluated the models' performance using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability to provide accurate references with the answers. The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the large FM performed better than small FMs across all metrics. The most interesting result is that small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA-2 small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers. The study shows that reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed by using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain. et.al.|[2403.06857](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06857)|null|

However, significant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos. In this paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of DriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate user-defined driving videos. Specifically, an LLM interface is initially incorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories. Subsequently, a HDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories. Ultimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and spatial coherence in the generated driving videos. DriveDreamer-2 is the first world model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon driving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the training of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking). Furthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7, representing relative improvements of 30% and 50%. et.al.|[2403.06845](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06845)|null|

The model can answer questions it couldn't previously by retrieving knowledge relevant to the query. This approach improves performance in certain scenarios for specific tasks. However, if irrelevant texts are retrieved, it may impair model performance.

|**2024-03-11**|**ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts**|Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence.   Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%. et.al.|[2403.06838](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838)|null|

Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improves the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5 Pro's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 2.1 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content. et.al.|[2403.05530](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530)|null|
|**2024-03-08**|**GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipefor Near-Lossless Generative Inference of LLM**|Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x.

|**2024-03-08**|**Beyond Finite Data: Towards Data-free Out-of-distribution Generalization via Extrapola**|Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a favorable yet challenging property for deep neural networks. The core challenges lie in the limited availability of source domains that help models learn an invariant representation from the spurious features. Various domain augmentation have been proposed but largely rely on interpolating existing domains and frequently face difficulties in creating truly "novel" domains. Humans, on the other hand, can easily extrapolate novel domains, thus, an intriguing question arises: How can neural networks extrapolate like humans and achieve OOD generalization?   We introduce a novel approach to domain extrapolation that leverages reasoning ability and the extensive knowledge encapsulated within large language models (LLMs) to synthesize entirely new domains. Starting with the class of interest, we query the LLMs to extract relevant knowledge for these novel domains. We then bridge the gap between the text-centric knowledge derived from LLMs and the pixel input space of the model using text-to-image generation techniques. By augmenting the training set of domain generalization datasets with high-fidelity, photo-realistic images of these new domains, we achieve significant improvements over all existing methods, as demonstrated in both single and multi-domain generalization across various benchmarks.   With the ability to extrapolate any domains for any class, our method has the potential to learn a generalized model for any task without any data. To illustrate, we put forth a much more difficult setting termed, data-free domain generalization, that aims to learn a generalized model in the absence of any collected data. Our empirical findings support the above argument and our methods exhibit commendable performance in this setting, even surpassing the supervised setting by approximately 1-2\% on datasets such as VLCS. et.al.|[2403.05523](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05523)|null|

We find that GPT-4 can play the game to a passable degree: it is able to manipulate doors, combat enemies, and perform pathing. More complex prompting strategies involving multiple model calls provide better results. While further work is required to enable the LLM to play the game as well as its classical, reinforcement learning-based counterparts, we note that GPT-4 required no training, leaning instead on its own reasoning and observational capabilities. We hope our work pushes the boundaries on intelligent, LLM-based agents in video games.

|**2024-03-08**|**Cost-Performance Optimization for Processing Low-Resource Language Tasks Using Commercial LLMs**|Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero/few-shot inference and generation quality for high-resource languages(HRLs). A few of them have been trained in low-resource languages (LRLs) and give decent performance. Owing to the prohibitive costs of training LLMs, they are usually used as a network service, with the client charged by the count of input and output tokens. The number of tokens strongly depends on the script and language, as well as the LLM's sub-word vocabulary. We show that LRLs are at a pricing disadvantage, because the well-known LLMs produce more tokens for LRLs than HRLs. This is because most currently popular LLMs are optimized for HRL vocabularies. Our objective is to level the playing field: reduce the cost of processing LRLs in contemporary LLMs while ensuring that predictive and generative qualities are not compromised. As means to reduce the number of tokens processed by the LLM, we consider code-mixing, translation, and transliteration of LRLs to HRLs. We perform an extensive study using the IndicXTREME dataset, covering 15 Indian languages, while using GPT-4 (one of the costliest LLM services released so far) as a commercial LLM. We observe and analyze interesting patterns involving token count, cost,and quality across a multitude of languages and tasks. We show that choosing the best policy to interact with the LLM can reduce cost by 90% while giving better or comparable performance, compared to communicating with the LLM in the original LRL. et.al.|[2403.05434](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05434)|null|

Currently, prompt-based models are gaining popularity, i.a., due to their easier adaptability in low-resource settings. However, the quality of attribution scores extracted from prompt-based models has not been investigated yet. In this work, we address this topic by analyzing attribution scores extracted from prompt-based models w.r.t. plausibility and faithfulness and comparing them with attribution scores extracted from fine-tuned models and large language models. In contrast to previous work, we introduce training size as another dimension into the analysis. We find that using the prompting paradigm (with either encoder-based or decoder-based models) yields more plausible explanations than fine-tuning the models in low-resource settings and Shapley Value Sampling consistently outperforms attention and Integrated Gradients in terms of leading to more plausible and faithful explanations. et.al.|[2403.05338](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05338)|null|

However, existing studies on interactive ASU largely ignore the coreference issue for opinion targets (i.e., aspects), while this phenomenon is ubiquitous in interactive scenarios especially dialogues, limiting the ASU performance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) shows the powerful ability to integrate various NLP tasks with the chat paradigm. In this way, this paper proposes a new Chat-based Aspect Sentiment Understanding (ChatASU) task, aiming to explore LLMs' ability in understanding aspect sentiments in dialogue scenarios. Particularly, this ChatASU task introduces a sub-task, i.e., Aspect Chain Reasoning (ACR) task, to address the aspect coreference issue. On this basis, we propose a Trusted Self-reflexion Approach (TSA) with ChatGLM as backbone to ChatASU. Specifically, this TSA treats the ACR task as an auxiliary task to boost the performance of the primary ASU task, and further integrates trusted learning into reflexion mechanisms to alleviate the LLMs-intrinsic factual hallucination problem in TSA. Furthermore, a high-quality ChatASU dataset is annotated to evaluate TSA, and extensive experiments show that our proposed TSA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art baselines, justifying the effectiveness of TSA to ChatASU and the importance of considering the coreference and hallucination issues in ChatASU. et.al.|[2403.05326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05326)|null|

In particular, the proposed method -- *retrieval-augmented thoughts* (RAT) -- revises each thought step one by one with retrieved information relevant to the task query, the current and the past thought steps, after the initial zero-shot CoT is generated. Applying RAT to GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and CodeLLaMA-7b substantially improves their performances on various long-horizon generation tasks; on average of relatively increasing rating scores by 13.63% on code generation, 16.96% on mathematical reasoning, 19.2% on creative writing, and 42.78% on embodied task planning.

|**2024-03-08**|**Tapilot-Crossing: Benchmarking and Evolving LLMs Towards Interactive Data Analysis Agents**|Interactive Data Analysis, the collaboration between humans and LLM agents, enables real-time data exploration for informed decision-making. The challenges and costs of collecting realistic interactive logs for data analysis hinder the quantitative evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in this task. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Tapilot-Crossing, a new benchmark to evaluate LLM agents on interactive data analysis. Tapilot-Crossing contains 1024 interactions, covering 4 practical scenarios: Normal, Action, Private, and Private Action. Notably, Tapilot-Crossing is constructed by an economical multi-agent environment, Decision Company, with few human efforts. We evaluate popular and advanced LLM agents in Tapilot-Crossing, which underscores the challenges of interactive data analysis. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Interaction Reflection (AIR), a self-generated reflection strategy that guides LLM agents to learn from successful history. Experiments demonstrate that Air can evolve LLMs into effective interactive data analysis agents, achieving a relative performance improvement of up to 44.5%. et.al.|[2403.05307](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05307)|null|
|**2024-03-08**|**ACLSum: A New Dataset for Aspect-based Summarization of Scientific Publications**|Extensive efforts in the past have been directed toward the development of summarization datasets. However, a predominant number of these resources have been (semi)-automatically generated, typically through web data crawling, resulting in subpar resources for training and evaluating summarization systems, a quality compromise that is arguably due to the substantial costs associated with generating ground-truth summaries, particularly for diverse languages and specialized domains. To address this issue, we present ACLSum, a novel summarization dataset carefully crafted and evaluated by domain experts. In contrast to previous datasets, ACLSum facilitates multi-aspect summarization of scientific papers, covering challenges, approaches, and outcomes in depth. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the quality of our resource and the performance of models based on pretrained language models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of extractive versus abstractive summarization within the scholarly domain on the basis of automatically discovered aspects. Our results corroborate previous findings in the general domain and indicate the general superiority of end-to-end aspect-based summarization.

|**2024-03-07**|**iScore: Visual Analytics for Interpreting How Language Models Automatically Score Summaries**|The recent explosion in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has inspired learning engineers to incorporate them into adaptive educational tools that automatically score summary writing. Understanding and evaluating LLMs is vital before deploying them in critical learning environments, yet their unprecedented size and expanding number of parameters inhibits transparency and impedes trust when they underperform. Through a collaborative user-centered design process with several learning engineers building and deploying summary scoring LLMs, we characterized fundamental design challenges and goals around interpreting their models, including aggregating large text inputs, tracking score provenance, and scaling LLM interpretability methods. To address their concerns, we developed iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool for learning engineers to upload, score, and compare multiple summaries simultaneously. Tightly integrated views allow users to iteratively revise the language in summaries, track changes in the resulting LLM scores, and visualize model weights at multiple levels of abstraction. To validate our approach, we deployed iScore with three learning engineers over the course of a month. We present a case study where interacting with iScore led a learning engineer to improve their LLM's score accuracy by three percentage points. Finally, we conducted qualitative interviews with the learning engineers that revealed how iScore enabled them to understand, evaluate, and build trust in their LLMs during deployment. et.al.|[2403.04760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04760)|**[link](https://github.com/adamcoscia/iscore)**|

We present KnowledgeVis, a human-in-the-loop visual analytics system for interpreting language models using fill-in-the-blank sentences as prompts. By comparing predictions between sentences, KnowledgeVis reveals learned associations that intuitively connect what language models learn during training to natural language tasks downstream, helping users create and test multiple prompt variations, analyze predicted words using a novel semantic clustering technique, and discover insights using interactive visualizations. Collectively, these visualizations help users identify the likelihood and uniqueness of individual predictions, compare sets of predictions between prompts, and summarize patterns and relationships between predictions across all prompts. We demonstrate the capabilities of KnowledgeVis with feedback from six NLP experts as well as three different use cases: (1) probing biomedical knowledge in two domain-adapted models; and (2) evaluating harmful identity stereotypes and (3) discovering facts and relationships between three general-purpose models. et.al.|[2403.04758](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04758)|**[link](https://github.com/adamcoscia/knowledgevis)**|
|**2024-03-07**|**LLMs in the Imaginarium: Tool Learning through Simulated Trial and Error**|Tools are essential for large language models (LLMs) to acquire up-to-date information and take consequential actions in external environments. Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools. However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained. We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory. Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback. Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on ToolBench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4. We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy. et.al.|[2403.04746](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04746)|**[link](https://github.com/microsoft/simulated-trial-and-error)**|
|**2024-03-07**|**ObjectCompose: Evaluating Resilience of Vision-Based Models on Object-to-Background Compositional Changes**|Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations. The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions. Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models. This allows us to quantify the role of background context in understanding the robustness and generalization of deep neural networks. We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. We conduct extensive experiment to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks. et.al.|[2403.04701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04701)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Fact-Checking the Output of Large Language Models via Token-Level Uncertainty Quantification**|Large language models (LLMs) are notorious for hallucinating, i.e., producing erroneous claims in their output. Such hallucinations can be dangerous, as occasional factual inaccuracies in the generated text might be obscured by the rest of the output being generally factual, making it extremely hard for the users to spot them. Current services that leverage LLMs usually do not provide any means for detecting unreliable generations. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose a novel fact-checking and hallucination detection pipeline based on token-level uncertainty quantification. Uncertainty scores leverage information encapsulated in the output of a neural network or its layers to detect unreliable predictions, and we show that they can be used to fact-check the atomic claims in the LLM output. Moreover, we present a novel token-level uncertainty quantification method that removes the impact of uncertainty about what claim to generate on the current step and what surface form to use. Our method Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP) measures only the uncertainty of particular claim value expressed by the model. Experiments on the task of biography generation demonstrate strong improvements for CCP compared to the baselines for six different LLMs and three languages. Human evaluation reveals that the fact-checking pipeline based on uncertainty quantification is competitive with a fact-checking tool that leverages external knowledge. et.al.|[2403.04696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04696)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Telecom Language Models: Must They Be Large?**|The increasing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) within the telecommunications sector underscores their potential to revolutionize operational efficiency. However, the deployment of these sophisticated models is often hampered by their substantial size and computational demands, raising concerns about their viability in resource-constrained environments. Addressing this challenge, recent advancements have seen the emergence of small language models that surprisingly exhibit performance comparable to their larger counterparts in many tasks, such as coding and common-sense reasoning. Phi-2, a compact yet powerful model, exemplifies this new wave of efficient small language models. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of Phi-2's intrinsic understanding of the telecommunications domain. Recognizing the scale-related limitations, we enhance Phi-2's capabilities through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, meticulously integrating an extensive knowledge base specifically curated with telecom standard specifications. The enhanced Phi-2 model demonstrates a profound improvement in accuracy, answering questions about telecom standards with a precision that closely rivals the more resource-intensive GPT-3.5. The paper further explores the refined capabilities of Phi-2 in addressing problem-solving scenarios within the telecom sector, highlighting its potential and limitations. et.al.|[2403.04666](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04666)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (\textbf{RLHF}) has emerged as a dominant approach for aligning LLM outputs with human preferences. Inspired by the success of RLHF, we study the performance of multiple algorithms that learn from feedback (Expert Iteration, Proximal Policy Optimization (\textbf{PPO}), Return-Conditioned RL) on improving LLM reasoning capabilities. We investigate both sparse and dense rewards provided to the LLM both heuristically and via a learned reward model. We additionally start from multiple model sizes and initializations both with and without supervised fine-tuning (\textbf{SFT}) data. Overall, we find all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases. Surprisingly, we find the sample complexity of Expert Iteration is similar to that of PPO, requiring at most on the order of $10^6$ samples to converge from a pretrained checkpoint. We investigate why this is the case, concluding that during RL training models fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models. Additionally, we discuss a trade off between maj@1 and pass@96 metric performance during SFT training and how conversely RL training improves both simultaneously. We then conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for RLHF and the future role of RL in LLM fine-tuning. et.al.|[2403.04642](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04642)|null|
|**2024-03-07**|**CAT: Enhancing Multimodal Large Language Model to Answer Questions in Dynamic Audio-Visual Scenarios**|This paper focuses on the challenge of answering questions in scenarios that are composed of rich and complex dynamic audio-visual components. Although existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can respond to audio-visual content, these responses are sometimes ambiguous and fail to describe specific audio-visual events. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the CAT, which enhances MLLM in three ways: 1) besides straightforwardly bridging audio and video, we design a clue aggregator that aggregates question-related clues in dynamic audio-visual scenarios to enrich the detailed knowledge required for large language models. 2) CAT is trained on a mixed multimodal dataset, allowing direct application in audio-visual scenarios. Notably, we collect an audio-visual joint instruction dataset named AVinstruct, to further enhance the capacity of CAT to model cross-semantic correlations. 3) we propose AI-assisted ambiguity-aware direct preference optimization, a strategy specialized in retraining the model to favor the non-ambiguity response and improve the ability to localize specific audio-visual objects. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAT outperforms existing methods on multimodal tasks, especially in Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks.

|**2024-03-07**|**A Detailed Audio-Text Data Simulation Pipeline using Single-Event Sounds**|Recently, there has been an increasing focus on audio-text cross-modal learning. However, most of the existing audio-text datasets contain only simple descriptions of sound events. Compared with classification labels, the advantages of such descriptions are significantly limited. In this paper, we first analyze the detailed information that human descriptions of audio may contain beyond sound event labels. Based on the analysis, we propose an automatic pipeline for curating audio-text pairs with rich details. Leveraging the property that sounds can be mixed and concatenated in the time domain, we control details in four aspects: temporal relationship, loudness, speaker identity, and occurrence number, in simulating audio mixtures. Corresponding details are transformed into captions by large language models. Audio-text pairs with rich details in text descriptions are thereby obtained. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline with a small amount of simulated data, demonstrating that the simulated data enables models to learn detailed audio captioning. et.al.|[2403.04594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04594)|null|

In this paper, we analyse a widely used benchmark dataset for evaluation of TI tasks, particularly focusing on the entity linking task. Our analysis reveals that this dataset is overly simplified, potentially reducing its effectiveness for thorough evaluation and failing to accurately represent tables as they appear in the real-world. To overcome this drawback, we construct and annotate a new more challenging dataset. In addition to introducing the new dataset, we also introduce a novel problem aimed at addressing the entity linking task: named entity recognition within cells. Finally, we propose a prompting framework for evaluating the newly developed large language models (LLMs) on this novel TI task. We conduct experiments on prompting LLMs under various settings, where we use both random and similarity-based selection to choose the examples presented to the models. Our ablation study helps us gain insights into the impact of the few-shot examples. Additionally, we perform qualitative analysis to gain insights into the challenges encountered by the models and to understand the limitations of the proposed dataset. et.al.|[2403.04577](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04577)|null|

BLaIR is trained to learn correlations between item metadata and potential natural language context, which is useful for retrieving and recommending items. To pretrain BLaIR, we collect Amazon Reviews 2023, a new dataset comprising over 570 million reviews and 48 million items from 33 categories, significantly expanding beyond the scope of previous versions. We evaluate the generalization ability of BLaIR across multiple domains and tasks, including a new task named complex product search, referring to retrieving relevant items given long, complex natural language contexts. Leveraging large language models like ChatGPT, we correspondingly construct a semi-synthetic evaluation set, Amazon-C4. Empirical results on the new task, as well as conventional retrieval and recommendation tasks, demonstrate that BLaIR exhibit strong text and item representation capacity.

|**2024-03-06**|**Did Translation Models Get More Robust Without Anyone Even Noticing?**|Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to "noisy" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues. In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased. et.al.|[2403.03923](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03923)|null|

Vulnerabilities in BusyBox can have far-reaching consequences, affecting a wide array of devices. This research, driven by the extensive use of BusyBox, delved into its analysis. The study revealed the prevalence of older BusyBox versions in real-world embedded products, prompting us to conduct fuzz testing on BusyBox. Fuzzing, a pivotal software testing method, aims to induce crashes that are subsequently scrutinized to uncover vulnerabilities. Within this study, we introduce two techniques to fortify software testing. The first technique enhances fuzzing by leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) to generate target-specific initial seeds. Our study showed a substantial increase in crashes when using LLM-generated initial seeds, highlighting the potential of LLM to efficiently tackle the typically labor-intensive task of generating target-specific initial seeds. The second technique involves repurposing previously acquired crash data from similar fuzzed targets before initiating fuzzing on a new target. This approach streamlines the time-consuming fuzz testing process by providing crash data directly to the new target before commencing fuzzing. We successfully identified crashes in the latest BusyBox target without conducting traditional fuzzing, emphasizing the effectiveness of LLM and crash reuse techniques in enhancing software testing and improving vulnerability detection in embedded systems. Additionally, manual triaging was performed to identify the nature of crashes in the latest BusyBox. et.al.|[2403.03897](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03897)|null|

|**2024-03-06**|**Learning to Decode Collaboratively with Multiple Language Models**|We propose a method to teach multiple large language models (LLM) to collaborate by interleaving their generations at the token level. We model the decision of which LLM generates the next token as a latent variable. By optimizing the marginal likelihood of a training set under our latent variable model, the base LLM automatically learns when to generate itself and when to call on one of the ``assistant'' language models to generate, all without direct supervision. Token-level collaboration during decoding allows for a fusion of each model's expertise in a manner tailored to the specific task at hand. Our collaborative decoding is especially useful in cross-domain settings where a generalist base LLM learns to invoke domain expert models. On instruction-following, domain-specific QA, and reasoning tasks, we show that the performance of the joint system exceeds that of the individual models. Through qualitative analysis of the learned latent decisions, we show models trained with our method exhibit several interesting collaboration patterns, e.g., template-filling.

In this work, we study the origins of such linear representations. To that end, we introduce a simple latent variable model to abstract and formalize the concept dynamics of the next token prediction. We use this formalism to show that the next token prediction objective (softmax with cross-entropy) and the implicit bias of gradient descent together promote the linear representation of concepts. Experiments show that linear representations emerge when learning from data matching the latent variable model, confirming that this simple structure already suffices to yield linear representations. We additionally confirm some predictions of the theory using the LLaMA-2 large language model, giving evidence that the simplified model yields generalizable insights. et.al.|[2403.03867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03867)|null|

In this work, we examine one increasingly common instruction-following task: providing writing assistance to compose a long-form answer. To evaluate the capabilities of current LLMs on this task, we construct KIWI, a dataset of knowledge-intensive writing instructions in the scientific domain. Given a research question, an initial model-generated answer and a set of relevant papers, an expert annotator iteratively issues instructions for the model to revise and improve its answer. We collect 1,260 interaction turns from 234 interaction sessions with three state-of-the-art LLMs. Each turn includes a user instruction, a model response, and a human evaluation of the model response. Through a detailed analysis of the collected responses, we find that all models struggle to incorporate new information into an existing answer, and to perform precise and unambiguous edits. Further, we find that models struggle to judge whether their outputs successfully followed user instructions, with accuracy at least 10 points short of human agreement. Our findings indicate that KIWI will be a valuable resource to measure progress and improve LLMs' instruction-following capabilities for knowledge intensive writing tasks. et.al.|[2403.03866](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03866)|null|

We present a new dataset, AlgoPuzzleVQA designed to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of multimodal language models in solving algorithmic puzzles that necessitate both visual understanding, language understanding, and complex algorithmic reasoning. We create the puzzles to encompass a diverse array of mathematical and algorithmic topics such as boolean logic, combinatorics, graph theory, optimization, search, etc., aiming to evaluate the gap between visual data interpretation and algorithmic problem-solving skills. The dataset is generated automatically from code authored by humans. All our puzzles have exact solutions that can be found from the algorithm without tedious human calculations. It ensures that our dataset can be scaled up arbitrarily in terms of reasoning complexity and dataset size.

Traditional approaches often treat frequent-shot (freq-shot; labels with abundant instances), few-shot, and zero-shot learning as distinct challenges, optimizing systems for just one of these scenarios. Yet, in real-world settings, label occurrences vary greatly. Some of them might appear thousands of times, while others might only appear sporadically or not at all. For practical deployment, it is crucial that a system can adapt to any label occurrence. We introduce a novel classification challenge: X-shot, reflecting a real-world context where freq-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot labels co-occur without predefined limits. Here, X can span from 0 to positive infinity. The crux of X-shot centers on open-domain generalization and devising a system versatile enough to manage various label scenarios. To solve X-shot, we propose BinBin (Binary INference Based on INstruction following) that leverages the Indirect Supervision from a large collection of NLP tasks via instruction following, bolstered by Weak Supervision provided by large language models. BinBin surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques on three benchmark datasets across multiple domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work addressing X-shot learning, where X remains variable. et.al.|[2403.03863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03863)|**[link](https://github.com/xhz0809/x-shot)**|

They can emphasize or clarify emotions, add details to conversations, or simply serve decorative purposes. This casual use, however, barely scratches the surface of the expressive power of emoji. To further unleash this power, we present Emojinize, a method for translating arbitrary text phrases into sequences of one or more emoji without requiring human input. By leveraging the power of large language models, Emojinize can choose appropriate emoji by disambiguating based on context (eg, cricket-bat vs bat) and can express complex concepts compositionally by combining multiple emoji (eq, ''Emojinize'' is translated to input-latin-letters right-arrow grinning-face). In a cloze test--based user study, we show that Emojinize's emoji translations increase the human guessability of masked words by 55%, whereas human-picked emoji translations do so by only 29%. These results suggest that emoji provide a sufficiently rich vocabulary to accurately translate a wide variety of words. Moreover, annotating words and phrases with Emojinize's emoji translations opens the door to numerous downstream applications, including children learning how to read, adults learning foreign languages, and text understanding for people with learning disabilities. et.al.|[2403.03857](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03857)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning**|The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai et.al.|[2403.03218](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03218)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**CLEVR-POC: Reasoning-Intensive Visual Question Answering in Partially Observable Environments**|The integration of learning and reasoning is high on the research agenda in AI. Nevertheless, there is only a little attention to use existing background knowledge for reasoning about partially observed scenes to answer questions about the scene. Yet, we as humans use such knowledge frequently to infer plausible answers to visual questions (by eliminating all inconsistent ones). Such knowledge often comes in the form of constraints about objects and it tends to be highly domain or environment-specific. We contribute a novel benchmark called CLEVR-POC for reasoning-intensive visual question answering (VQA) in partially observable environments under constraints. In CLEVR-POC, knowledge in the form of logical constraints needs to be leveraged to generate plausible answers to questions about a hidden object in a given partial scene. For instance, if one has the knowledge that all cups are colored either red, green or blue and that there is only one green cup, it becomes possible to deduce the color of an occluded cup as either red or blue, provided that all other cups, including the green one, are observed. Through experiments, we observe that the low performance of pre-trained vision language models like CLIP (~ 22%) and a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 (~ 46%) on CLEVR-POC ascertains the necessity for frameworks that can handle reasoning-intensive tasks where environment-specific background knowledge is available and crucial. Furthermore, our demonstration illustrates that a neuro-symbolic model, which integrates an LLM like GPT-4 with a visual perception network and a formal logical reasoner, exhibits exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC. et.al.|[2403.03203](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03203)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**Towards Democratized Flood Risk Management: An Advanced AI Assistant Enabled by GPT-4 for Enhanced Interpretability and Public Engagement**|Real-time flood forecasting plays a crucial role in enabling timely and effective emergency responses. However, a significant challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex numerical flood models and practical decision-making. Decision-makers often rely on experts to interpret these models for optimizing flood mitigation strategies. And the public requires complex techniques to inquiry and understand socio-cultural and institutional factors, often hinders the public's understanding of flood risks. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces an innovative solution: a customized AI Assistant powered by the GPT-4 Large Language Model. This AI Assistant is designed to facilitate effective communication between decision-makers, the general public, and flood forecasters, without the requirement of specialized knowledge. The new framework utilizes GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding and function calling capabilities to provide immediate flood alerts and respond to various flood-related inquiries. Our developed prototype integrates real-time flood warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It also effectively translates complex flood zone information into actionable risk management advice. To assess its performance, we evaluated the prototype using six criteria within three main categories: relevance, error resilience, and understanding of context. Our research marks a significant step towards a more accessible and user-friendly approach in flood risk management. This study highlights the potential of advanced AI tools like GPT-4 in democratizing information and enhancing public engagement in critical social and environmental issues. et.al.|[2403.03188](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03188)|**[link](https://github.com/rafaelamartelo/floodgpt-4_prototype)**|
|**2024-03-05**|**SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection**|Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations. et.al.|[2403.03170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03170)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**PARADISE: Evaluating Implicit Planning Skills of Language Models with Procedural Warnings and Tips Dataset**|Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans. However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis. To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow. It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal. Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios. Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance. Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks. The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise. et.al.|[2403.03167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03167)|**[link](https://github.com/gglab-ku/paradise)**|
|**2024-03-05**|**Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale. et.al.|[2403.03154](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03154)|null|

Large Language Models (LLMs), with a wealth of world knowledge, can help RL agents learn quickly and adapt to distribution shifts. In this work, we introduce Language Guided Exploration (LGE) framework, which uses a pre-trained language model (called GUIDE ) to provide decision-level guidance to an RL agent (called EXPLORER). We observe that on ScienceWorld (Wang et al.,2022), a challenging text environment, LGE outperforms vanilla RL agents significantly and also outperforms other sophisticated methods like Behaviour Cloning and Text Decision Transformer. et.al.|[2403.03141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03141)|null|
|**2024-03-05**|**Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes in Emotion Attribution**|Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications. et.al.|[2403.03121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03121)|null|

However, most existing approaches rely on pre-defined personal profiles, which are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive to create but also lack flexibility. We propose In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a fine-tuning framework that enhances the ability of pre-trained large language models to leverage dialogue history to characterize persona for completing personalized dialogue generation tasks without pre-defined profiles. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that IDL brings substantial improvements, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by up to 200% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, the results of human evaluations further validate the efficacy of our proposed method. et.al.|[2403.03102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03102)|null|

This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation.

This study compares prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-7b, in zero-shot and one-shot settings for this task. Our findings show GPT-4's superior performance, particularly in the one-shot scenario. A central part of this research is the introduction of `LM4OPT,' a progressive fine-tuning framework for Llama-2-7b that utilizes noisy embeddings and specialized datasets. However, this research highlights a notable gap in the contextual understanding capabilities of smaller models such as Llama-2-7b compared to larger counterparts, especially in processing lengthy and complex input contexts. Our empirical investigation, utilizing the NL4Opt dataset, unveils that GPT-4 surpasses the baseline performance established by previous research, achieving an F1-score of 0.63, solely based on the problem description in natural language, and without relying on any additional named entity information. GPT-3.5 follows closely, both outperforming the fine-tuned Llama-2-7b. These findings not only benchmark the current capabilities of LLMs in a novel application area but also lay the groundwork for future improvements in mathematical formulation of optimization problems from natural language input. et.al.|[2403.01342](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01342)|null|

Here, we show that a general purpose large language model, chatGPT 3.5-turbo, can be fine-tuned to learn the structural biophysics of DNA.

|**2024-03-02**|**VBART: The Turkish LLM**|We present VBART, the first Turkish sequence-to-sequence Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on a large corpus from scratch. VBART are compact LLMs based on good ideas leveraged from BART and mBART models and come in two sizes, Large and XLarge. Fine-tuned VBART models surpass the prior state-of-the-art results in abstractive text summarization, title generation, text paraphrasing, question answering and question generation tasks. They allow fine-tuning for future text generation tasks and datasets, carving a new path for Turkish Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Our work shows that having a pre-trained LLM for Turkish outperforms up to 3x multilingual models, improving existing results and providing efficient models for training and inference. Moreover, we show that our monolingual tokenizer is 7x more efficient than OpenAI's multilingual tokenizer. Last but not least, we introduce a method to enlarge an existing pre-trained LLM and question the relevancy of Chinchilla Scaling Law to sequence-to-sequence masked language models.

|**2024-03-02**|**Improving the Validity of Automatically Generated Feedback via Reinforcement Learning**|Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work. et.al.|[2403.01304](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01304)|**[link](https://github.com/umass-ml4ed/feedback-gen-dpo)**|

In this paper, we argue that there is a rare gem in modern CPUs, Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) registers, which allow for ultra-low-latency lookups in batch. We leverage this unique capability of CPUs to propose NoMAD-Attention, an efficient attention algorithm that replaces MAD operations with in-register lookups. Through hardware-aware algorithmic designs, NoMAD-Attention achieves the computation of attention scores using repeated fast accesses to SIMD registers despite their highly limited sizes. Moreover, NoMAD-Attention works with pre-trained attention-based LLMs without model finetuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NoMAD-Attention maintains the quality of the original LLMs well, and speeds up the 4-bit quantized LLaMA-7B-based model by up to 2 $\times$ at 16k context length.

Yet, creating comprehensive IRPs is often hindered by challenges such as complex systems, high turnover rates, and legacy technologies lacking documentation. This paper argues that, despite these obstacles, the development, review, and refinement of IRPs can be significantly enhanced through the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By leveraging LLMs for tasks such as drafting initial plans, suggesting best practices, and identifying documentation gaps, organizations can overcome resource constraints and improve their readiness for cybersecurity incidents. We discuss the potential of LLMs to streamline IRP processes, while also considering the limitations and the need for human oversight in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of generated content. Our findings contribute to the cybersecurity field by demonstrating a novel approach to enhancing IRP with AI technologies, offering practical insights for organizations seeking to bolster their incident response capabilities. et.al.|[2403.01271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01271)|null|

This approach is a compute- and data-efficient method for identifying and removing neurons that enable specific behaviours.

Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing prompts containing adversarial suffixes to break the presumingly safe LLMs, but the optimization of GCG is time-consuming and limits its practicality. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$ to accelerate the GCG algorithm. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates to reduce the computation time. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. et.al.|[2403.01251](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251)|**[link](https://github.com/zhaoyiran924/probe-sampling)**|

This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal. et.al.|[2403.01248](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01248)|null|
|**2024-03-02**|**Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Self-Synthesized Rehearsal**|Large language models (LLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. Conventional rehearsal-based methods rely on previous training data to retain the model's ability, which may not be feasible in real-world applications. When conducting continual learning based on a publicly-released LLM checkpoint, the availability of the original training data may be non-existent. To address this challenge, we propose a framework called Self-Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) that uses the LLM to generate synthetic instances for rehearsal. Concretely, we first employ the base LLM for in-context learning to generate synthetic instances. Subsequently, we utilize the latest LLM to refine the instance outputs based on the synthetic inputs, preserving its acquired ability. Finally, we select diverse high-quality synthetic instances for rehearsal in future stages. Experimental results demonstrate that SSR achieves superior or comparable performance compared to conventional rehearsal-based approaches while being more data-efficient. Besides, SSR effectively preserves the generalization capabilities of LLMs in general domains. et.al.|[2403.01244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01244)|null|

Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the format of standard instruction tuning data. In addition, we design a new benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin.

How do people navigate vast hypothesis spaces to pose informative questions given limited cognitive resources? We study these tradeoffs in a classic grounded question-asking task based on the board game Battleship. Our language-informed program sampling (LIPS) model uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language questions, translate them into symbolic programs, and evaluate their expected information gain. We find that with a surprisingly modest resource budget, this simple Monte Carlo optimization strategy yields informative questions that mirror human performance across varied Battleship board scenarios. In contrast, LLM-only baselines struggle to ground questions in the board state; notably, GPT-4V provides no improvement over non-visual baselines.

|**2024-02-29**|**Towards Tracing Trustworthiness Dynamics: Revisiting Pre-training Period of Large Language Models**|Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by~\citet{choi2023understanding} that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression~\citep{shwartz2017opening}. This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field.

To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs. However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming. Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM. However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM. To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty. Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods. Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs.

|**2024-02-29**|**ArCHer: Training Language Model Agents via Hierarchical Multi-Turn RL**|A broad use case of large language models (LLMs) is in goal-directed decision-making tasks (or "agent" tasks), where an LLM needs to not just generate completions for a given prompt, but rather make intelligent decisions over a multi-turn interaction to accomplish a task (e.g., when interacting with the web, using tools, or providing customer support). Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a general paradigm to address such agent tasks, but current RL methods for LLMs largely focus on optimizing single-turn rewards. By construction, most single-turn RL methods cannot endow LLMs with the ability to intelligently seek information over multiple turns, perform credit assignment, or reason about their past actions -- all of which are critical in agent tasks. This raises the question: how can we design effective and efficient multi-turn RL algorithms for LLMs? In this paper, we develop a framework for building multi-turn RL algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs, that preserves the flexibility of existing single-turn RL methods for LLMs (e.g., proximal policy optimization), while accommodating multiple turns, long horizons, and delayed rewards effectively. To do this, our framework adopts a hierarchical RL approach and runs two RL algorithms in parallel: a high-level off-policy value-based RL algorithm to aggregate reward over utterances, and a low-level RL algorithm that utilizes this high-level value function to train a token policy within each utterance or turn. Our hierarchical framework, Actor-Critic Framework with a Hierarchical Structure (ArCHer), can also give rise to other RL methods. Empirically, we find that ArCHer significantly improves efficiency and performance on agent tasks, attaining a sample efficiency of about 100x over existing methods, while also improving with larger model capacity (upto the 7 billion scale that we tested on). et.al.|[2402.19446](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19446)|**[link](https://github.com/yifeizhou02/archer)**|
|**2024-02-29**|**Compositional API Recommendation for Library-Oriented Code Generation**|Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation. However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs. Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs. However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs. This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task. To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements. Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks. Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask. Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation. To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).

|**2024-02-29**|**Crafting Knowledge: Exploring the Creative Mechanisms of Chat-Based Search Engines**|In the domain of digital information dissemination, search engines act as pivotal conduits linking information seekers with providers. The advent of chat-based search engines utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), exemplified by Bing Chat, marks an evolutionary leap in the search ecosystem. They demonstrate metacognitive abilities in interpreting web information and crafting responses with human-like understanding and creativity. Nonetheless, the intricate nature of LLMs renders their "cognitive" processes opaque, challenging even their designers' understanding. This research aims to dissect the mechanisms through which an LLM-powered chat-based search engine, specifically Bing Chat, selects information sources for its responses. To this end, an extensive dataset has been compiled through engagements with New Bing, documenting the websites it cites alongside those listed by the conventional search engine. Employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the research reveals that Bing Chat exhibits a preference for content that is not only readable and formally structured, but also demonstrates lower perplexity levels, indicating a unique inclination towards text that is predictable by the underlying LLM. Further enriching our analysis, we procure an additional dataset through interactions with the GPT-4 based knowledge retrieval API, unveiling a congruent text preference between the RAG API and Bing Chat. This consensus suggests that these text preferences intrinsically emerge from the underlying language models, rather than being explicitly crafted by Bing Chat's developers. Moreover, our investigation documents a greater similarity among websites cited by RAG technologies compared to those ranked highest by conventional search engines. et.al.|[2402.19421](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19421)|null|

This line of work has recently been revisited by extending this result to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose to fill the gap between well-established and recent literature by observing how geographical knowledge evolves when scaling language models. We show that geographical knowledge is observable even for tiny models, and that it scales consistently as we increase the model size. Notably, we observe that larger language models cannot mitigate the geographical bias that is inherent to the training data. et.al.|[2402.19406](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19406)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**Entity-Aware Multimodal Alignment Framework for News Image Captioning**|News image captioning task is a variant of image captioning task which requires model to generate a more informative caption with news image and the associated news article. Multimodal Large Language models have developed rapidly in recent years and is promising in news image captioning task. However, according to our experiments, common MLLMs are not good at generating the entities in zero-shot setting. Their abilities to deal with the entities information are still limited after simply fine-tuned on news image captioning dataset. To obtain a more powerful model to handle the multimodal entity information, we design two multimodal entity-aware alignment tasks and an alignment framework to align the model and generate the news image captions. Our method achieves better results than previous state-of-the-art models in CIDEr score (72.33 -> 86.29) on GoodNews dataset and (70.83 -> 85.61) on NYTimes800k dataset. et.al.|[2402.19404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19404)|null|
|**2024-02-29**|**Wisdom of the Silicon Crowd: LLM Ensemble Prediction Capabilities Match Human Crowd Accuracy**|Human forecasting accuracy in practice relies on the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, in which predictions about future events are significantly improved by aggregating across a crowd of individual forecasters. Past work on the forecasting ability of large language models (LLMs) suggests that frontier LLMs, as individual forecasters, underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate. In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is statistically equivalent to the human crowd. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions. Moreover, in Study 2, we test whether LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) can be improved by drawing on human cognitive output. We find that both models' forecasting accuracy benefits from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by between 17% and 28%: though this leads to less accurate predictions than simply averaging human and machine forecasts. Our results suggest that LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments: via the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation. This replicates the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, and opens up their use for a variety applications throughout society. et.al.|[2402.19379](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19379)|null|
|**2024-02-28**|**Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards**|Fine-grained control over large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, hindering their adaptability to diverse user needs. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) shows promise in aligning LLMs, its reliance on scalar rewards often limits its ability to capture diverse user preferences in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework. Unlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling to represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user preferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve user-dependent preference control. Our method involves training a multi-objective reward model and then fine-tuning the LLM with a preference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF), an RLHF method adopted by Llama 2. This method enjoys a better performance trade-off across various reward objectives. In comparison with the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA offers users intuitive control over LLM generation: they can arithmetically specify their desired trade-offs (e.g., more helpfulness with less verbosity). We also validate the effectiveness of DPA with real-world alignment experiments on Mistral-7B. Our method provides straightforward arithmetic control over the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity while maintaining competitive performance with strong baselines such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). et.al.|[2402.18571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18571)|**[link](https://github.com/haoxiang-wang/directional-preference-alignment)**|
|**2024-02-28**|**A Categorization of Complexity Classes for Information Retrieval and Synthesis Using Natural Logic**|Given the emergent reasoning abilities of large language models, information retrieval is becoming more complex. Rather than just retrieve a document, modern information retrieval systems advertise that they can synthesize an answer based on potentially many different documents, conflicting data sources, and using reasoning. But, different kinds of questions have different answers, and different answers have different complexities. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for analyzing the complexity of a question answer based on the natural deduction calculus as presented in Prawitz (1965). Our framework is novel both in that no one to our knowledge has used this logic as a basis for complexity classes, and also in that no other existing complexity classes to these have been delineated using any analogous methods either. We identify three decidable fragments in particular called the forward, query and planning fragments, and we compare this to what would be needed to do proofs for the complete first-order calculus, for which theorem-proving is long known to be undecidable. et.al.|[2402.18566](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18566)|null|
|**2024-02-28**|**Implicit Bias of Next-Token Prediction**|Next-token prediction (NTP), the go-to training paradigm in training large language models, involves predicting the next token in a sequence. Departing from traditional one-hot classification, in NTP, multiple tokens with varying frequencies follow each given context. This work frames NTP training as cross-entropy minimization over distinct contexts, each associated with a sparse empirical probability vector across a finite vocabulary. It then addresses the following question: do gradient-based optimizers exhibit a bias towards solutions with specific structure as the NTP training loss reaches its lower bound (entropy)? Specifically, for linear NTP models trained using gradient descent (GD), we make the following contributions: Firstly, we determine NTP-separability conditions on the data, under which GD can attain its lower bound. We also demonstrate that these conditions hold under overparameterization. Secondly, we establish that the parameters of GD projected onto an appropriate data subspace converge to the unique solution of a system of linear equations, which requires the logits' difference of in-support tokens to be equal to the log-ratio of their respective probabilities. Meanwhile, on the orthogonal subspace, the parameters diverge and converge in the direction of the solution of a max-margin quadratic program, minimizing the Euclidean norm of parameters satisfying the \NTP-separability conditions. Akin to prior research on implicit bias of one-hot classification, our work opens exciting avenues for future research that can lead to better understanding optimization, generalization and robustness principles of models trained with NTP. et.al.|[2402.18551](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18551)|null|
|**2024-02-28**|**Few-Shot Fairness: Unveiling LLM's Potential for Fairness-Aware Classification**|Employing Large Language Models (LLM) in various downstream applications such as classification is crucial, especially for smaller companies lacking the expertise and resources required for fine-tuning a model. Fairness in LLMs helps ensure inclusivity, equal representation based on factors such as race, gender and promotes responsible AI deployment. As the use of LLMs has become increasingly prevalent, it is essential to assess whether LLMs can generate fair outcomes when subjected to considerations of fairness. In this study, we introduce a framework outlining fairness regulations aligned with various fairness definitions, with each definition being modulated by varying degrees of abstraction. We explore the configuration for in-context learning and the procedure for selecting in-context demonstrations using RAG, while incorporating fairness rules into the process. Experiments conducted with different LLMs indicate that GPT-4 delivers superior results in terms of both accuracy and fairness compared to other models. This work is one of the early attempts to achieve fairness in prediction tasks by utilizing LLMs through in-context learning. et.al.|[2402.18502](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18502)|null|

While Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to possess certain ToM abilities, the mechanisms underlying these capabilities remain elusive. In this study, we discover that it is possible to linearly decode the belief status from the perspectives of various agents through neural activations of language models, indicating the existence of internal representations of self and others' beliefs. By manipulating these representations, we observe dramatic changes in the models' ToM performance, underscoring their pivotal role in the social reasoning process. Additionally, our findings extend to diverse social reasoning tasks that involve different causal inference patterns, suggesting the potential generalizability of these representations. et.al.|[2402.18496](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18496)|null|

Leveraging meta-task prompting, MetaEOL guides LLMs to produce embeddings through a series of carefully designed prompts that address multiple representational aspects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that embeddings averaged from various meta-tasks yield competitive performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks and excel in downstream tasks, surpassing contrastive-trained models.

|**2024-02-28**|**Beyond Natural Language: LLMs Leveraging Alternative Formats for Enhanced Reasoning and Communication**|Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.

This paper introduces the decomposed prompting approach to probe the linguistic structure understanding of these LLMs in sequence labeling tasks. Diverging from the single text-to-text prompt, our method generates for each token of the input sentence an individual prompt which asks for its linguistic label. We assess our method on the Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging dataset for 38 languages, utilizing both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Our findings show that decomposed prompting surpasses the iterative prompting baseline in efficacy and efficiency under zero- and few-shot settings. Further analysis reveals the influence of evaluation methods and the use of instructions in prompts. Our multilingual investigation shows that English-centric language models perform better on average than multilingual models. Our study offers insights into the multilingual transferability of English-centric LLMs, contributing to the understanding of their multilingual linguistic knowledge. et.al.|[2402.18397](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18397)|null|

|**2024-02-28**|**Large Language Models As Evolution Strategies**|Large Transformer models are capable of implementing a plethora of so-called in-context learning algorithms. These include gradient descent, classification, sequence completion, transformation, and improvement. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), which never explicitly encountered the task of black-box optimization, are in principle capable of implementing evolutionary optimization algorithms. While previous works have solely focused on language-based task specification, we move forward and focus on the zero-shot application of LLMs to black-box optimization. We introduce a novel prompting strategy, consisting of least-to-most sorting of discretized population members and querying the LLM to propose an improvement to the mean statistic, i.e. perform a type of black-box recombination operation. Empirically, we find that our setup allows the user to obtain an LLM-based evolution strategy, which we call `EvoLLM', that robustly outperforms baseline algorithms such as random search and Gaussian Hill Climbing on synthetic BBOB functions as well as small neuroevolution tasks. Hence, LLMs can act as `plug-in' in-context recombination operators. We provide several comparative studies of the LLM's model size, prompt strategy, and context construction. Finally, we show that one can flexibly improve EvoLLM's performance by providing teacher algorithm information via instruction fine-tuning on previously collected teacher optimization trajectories. et.al.|[2402.18381](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18381)|null|

In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective.

We call them massive activations. First, we demonstrate the widespread existence of massive activations across various LLMs and characterize their locations. Second, we find their values largely stay constant regardless of the input, and they function as indispensable bias terms in LLMs. Third, these massive activations lead to the concentration of attention probabilities to their corresponding tokens, and further, implicit bias terms in the self-attention output. Last, we also study massive activations in Vision Transformers. et.al.|[2402.17762](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17762)|**[link](https://github.com/locuslab/massive-activations)**|

Despite advancements in long-context large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques, their efficacy in very long-term dialogues remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we introduce a machine-human pipeline to generate high-quality, very long-term dialogues by leveraging LLM-based agent architectures and grounding their dialogues on personas and temporal event graphs. Moreover, we equip each agent with the capability of sharing and reacting to images. The generated conversations are verified and edited by human annotators for long-range consistency and grounding to the event graphs. Using this pipeline, we collect LoCoMo, a dataset of very long-term conversations, each encompassing 300 turns and 9K tokens on avg., over up to 35 sessions. Based on LoCoMo, we present a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to measure long-term memory in models, encompassing question answering, event summarization, and multi-modal dialogue generation tasks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs exhibit challenges in understanding lengthy conversations and comprehending long-range temporal and causal dynamics within dialogues.

While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same. Instead, they may rely on similar "cases" seen in the training corpus for help. We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as "rule-based reasoning" and "case-based reasoning". Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems. Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason. To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning. Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step. Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad. The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length. et.al.|[2402.17709](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17709)|**[link](https://github.com/graphpku/case_or_rule)**|

To address this, we propose NextLevelBERT, a Masked Language Model operating not on tokens, but on higher-level semantic representations in the form of text embeddings. We pretrain NextLevelBERT to predict the vector representation of entire masked text chunks and evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting document vectors on three task types: 1) Semantic Textual Similarity via zero-shot document embeddings, 2) Long document classification, 3) Multiple-choice question answering. We find that next level Masked Language Modeling is an effective technique to tackle long-document use cases and can outperform much larger embedding models as long as the required level of detail is not too high.

Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings. However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy domains. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They evince a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in foreign policy, migration, and economy. et.al.|[2402.17649](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17649)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**Integrating Large Language Models with Graphical Session-Based Recommendation**|With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems. While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity. SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors. The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs. In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks. This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session. Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration. et.al.|[2402.16539](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16539)|null|

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions. There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments. LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.

In this work, we aim at filling such a gap. First, we mine 1,501 commits, pull requests (PRs), and issues from open-source projects by matching regular expressions likely to indicate the usage of ChatGPT to accomplish the task. Then, we manually analyze these instances, discarding false positives (i.e., instances in which ChatGPT was mentioned but not actually used) and categorizing the task automated in the 467 true positive instances (165 commits, 159 PRs, 143 issues). This resulted in a taxonomy of 45 tasks which developers automate via ChatGPT. The taxonomy, accompanied with representative examples, provides (i) developers with valuable insights on how to exploit LLMs in their workflow and (ii) researchers with a clear overview of tasks that, according to developers, could benefit from automated solutions. et.al.|[2402.16480](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16480)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation**|Although many large language models (LLMs) have been trained to refuse harmful requests, they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which rewrite the original prompt to conceal its harmful intent. In this paper, we propose a new method for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks by ``backtranslation''. Specifically, given an initial response generated by the target LLM from an input prompt, our backtranslation prompts a language model to infer an input prompt that can lead to the response. The inferred prompt is called the backtranslated prompt which tends to reveal the actual intent of the original prompt, since it is generated based on the LLM's response and is not directly manipulated by the attacker. We then run the target LLM again on the backtranslated prompt, and we refuse the original prompt if the model refuses the backtranslated prompt. We explain that the proposed defense provides several benefits on its effectiveness and efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that our defense significantly outperforms the baselines, in the cases that are hard for the baselines, and our defense also has little impact on the generation quality for benign input prompts. et.al.|[2402.16459](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16459)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**ProLLaMA: A Protein Large Language Model for Multi-Task Protein Language Processing**|Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-x and LLaMA2, have achieved remarkable performance in multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Under the premise that protein sequences constitute the protein language, Protein Large Language Models (ProLLMs) trained on protein corpora excel at de novo protein sequence generation. However, as of now, unlike LLMs in NLP, no ProLLM is capable of multiple tasks in the Protein Language Processing (PLP) field. This prompts us to delineate the inherent limitations in current ProLLMs: (i) the lack of natural language capabilities, (ii) insufficient instruction understanding, and (iii) high training resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a training framework to transform any general LLM into a ProLLM capable of handling multiple PLP tasks. Specifically, our framework utilizes low-rank adaptation and employs a two-stage training approach, and it is distinguished by its universality, low overhead, and scalability. Through training under this framework, we propose the ProLLaMA model, the first known ProLLM to handle multiple PLP tasks simultaneously. Experiments show that ProLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results in the unconditional protein sequence generation task. In the controllable protein sequence generation task, ProLLaMA can design novel proteins with desired functionalities. In the protein property prediction task, ProLLaMA achieves nearly 100\% accuracy across many categories. The latter two tasks are beyond the reach of other ProLLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Lyu6PosHao/ProLLaMA}. et.al.|[2402.16445](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16445)|null|

In this paper, we propose ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector, which aligns with general human safety standards, supports customizable detection rules, and provides explanations for its decisions. To train ShieldLM, we compile a large bilingual dataset comprising 14,387 query-response pairs, annotating the safety of responses based on various safety standards. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ShieldLM surpasses strong baselines across four test sets, showcasing remarkable customizability and explainability. Besides performing well on standard detection datasets, ShieldLM has also been shown to be effective in real-world situations as a safety evaluator for advanced LLMs. We release ShieldLM at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/ShieldLM} to support accurate and explainable safety detection under various safety standards, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance the safety of LLMs. et.al.|[2402.16444](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16444)|**[link](https://github.com/thu-coai/shieldlm)**|

It remains a challenging problem to explain the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs process multilingual texts. In this paper, we delve into the composition of Transformer architectures in LLMs to pinpoint language-specific regions. Specially, we propose a novel detection method, language activation probability entropy (LAPE), to identify language-specific neurons within LLMs. Based on LAPE, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two representative LLMs, namely LLaMA-2 and BLOOM. Our findings indicate that LLMs' proficiency in processing a particular language is predominantly due to a small subset of neurons, primarily situated in the models' top and bottom layers. Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility to "steer" the output language of LLMs by selectively activating or deactivating language-specific neurons. Our research provides important evidence to the understanding and exploration of the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. et.al.|[2402.16438](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16438)|null|
|**2024-02-26**|**RoCoIns: Enhancing Robustness of Large Language Models through Code-Style Instructions**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in following human instructions. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the robustness of LLMs when prompted with instructions combining textual adversarial samples. In this paper, drawing inspiration from recent works that LLMs are sensitive to the design of the instructions, we utilize instructions in code style, which are more structural and less ambiguous, to replace typically natural language instructions. Through this conversion, we provide LLMs with more precise instructions and strengthen the robustness of LLMs. Moreover, under few-shot scenarios, we propose a novel method to compose in-context demonstrations using both clean and adversarial samples (\textit{adversarial context method}) to further boost the robustness of the LLMs. Experiments on eight robustness datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prompting LLMs with natural language instructions. For example, with gpt-3.5-turbo, our method achieves an improvement of 5.68\% in test set accuracy and a reduction of 5.66 points in Attack Success Rate (ASR). et.al.|[2402.16431](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16431)|null|

Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to rapidly generate first versions of these documents, however there are concerns about the quality of their output Here we report an evaluation of LLMs in generating parts of one such document, clinical trial protocols. We find that an offthe-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially when assessing content relevance and the correct use of terminology. However, deficiencies remain: specifically clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references. To improve performance, we used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to prompt an LLM with accurate up-to-date information. As a result of using RAG, the writing quality of the LLM improves substantially, which has implications for the practical useability of LLMs in clinical trial-related writing. et.al.|[2402.16406](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16406)|null|

However, there is limited understanding of how well LLMs perform in specific domains (e.g, the intellectual property (IP) domain). In this paper, we contribute a new benchmark, the first Multilingual-oriented quiZ on Intellectual Property (MoZIP), for the evaluation of LLMs in the IP domain. The MoZIP benchmark includes three challenging tasks: IP multiple-choice quiz (IPQuiz), IP question answering (IPQA), and patent matching (PatentMatch). In addition, we also develop a new IP-oriented multilingual large language model (called MoZi), which is a BLOOMZ-based model that has been supervised fine-tuned with multilingual IP-related text data. We evaluate our proposed MoZi model and four well-known LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, BELLE, ChatGLM and ChatGPT) on the MoZIP benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that MoZi outperforms BLOOMZ, BELLE and ChatGLM by a noticeable margin, while it had lower scores compared with ChatGPT. Notably, the performance of current LLMs on the MoZIP benchmark has much room for improvement, and even the most powerful ChatGPT does not reach the passing level.

However, this focus overlooks another source of misalignment: bad actors might purposely fine-tune LLMs to achieve harmful goals. In this paper, we present an emerging threat model that has arisen from alignment circumvention and fine-tuning attacks. However, lacking in previous works is a clear presentation of the conditions for effective defence. We propose a set of conditions for effective defence against harmful fine-tuning in LLMs called "Immunization conditions," which help us understand how we would construct and measure future defences. Using this formal framework for defence, we offer a synthesis of different research directions that might be persued to prevent harmful fine-tuning attacks and provide a demonstration of how to use these conditions experimentally showing early results of using an adversarial loss to immunize LLama2-7b-chat. et.al.|[2402.16382](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16382)|null|

It meticulously standardizes and unifies these trajectories into a consistent format, streamlining the creation of a generic data loader optimized for agent training.

As such, there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques, while the second has involved curating task-adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool-based tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, slot filling, and sequencing of the detected APIs.

|**2024-02-23**|**Prejudice and Caprice: A Statistical Framework for Measuring Social Discrimination in Large Language Models**|The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into social operations amplifies their impact on decisions in crucial areas such as economics, law, education, and healthcare, raising public concerns about these models' discrimination-related safety and reliability. However, prior discrimination measuring frameworks solely assess the average discriminatory behavior of LLMs, often proving inadequate due to the overlook of an additional discrimination-leading factor, i.e., the LLMs' prediction variation across diverse contexts. In this work, we present the Prejudice-Caprice Framework (PCF) that comprehensively measures discrimination in LLMs by considering both their consistently biased preference and preference variation across diverse contexts. Specifically, we mathematically dissect the aggregated contextualized discrimination risk of LLMs into prejudice risk, originating from LLMs' persistent prejudice, and caprice risk, stemming from their generation inconsistency. In addition, we utilize a data-mining approach to gather preference-detecting probes from sentence skeletons, devoid of attribute indications, to approximate LLMs' applied contexts. While initially intended for assessing discrimination in LLMs, our proposed PCF facilitates the comprehensive and flexible measurement of any inductive biases, including knowledge alongside prejudice, across various modality models. We apply our discrimination-measuring framework to 12 common LLMs, yielding intriguing findings: i) modern LLMs demonstrate significant pro-male stereotypes, ii) LLMs' exhibited discrimination correlates with several social and economic factors, iii) prejudice risk dominates the overall discrimination risk and follows a normal distribution, and iv) caprice risk contributes minimally to the overall risk but follows a fat-tailed distribution, suggesting that it is wild risk requiring enhanced surveillance. et.al.|[2402.15481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15481)|null|

In this work, we address an architectural limitation of autoregressive models: token embeddings cannot contain information from tokens that appear later in the input. To address this limitation, we propose a simple approach, "echo embeddings," in which we repeat the input twice in context and extract embeddings from the second occurrence. We show that echo embeddings of early tokens can encode information about later tokens, allowing us to maximally leverage high-quality LLMs for embeddings. On the MTEB leaderboard, echo embeddings improve over classical embeddings by over 9% zero-shot and by around 0.7% when fine-tuned. Echo embeddings with a Mistral-7B model achieve state-of-the-art compared to prior open source models that do not leverage synthetic fine-tuning data. et.al.|[2402.15449](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15449)|**[link](https://github.com/jakespringer/echo-embeddings)**|

In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate patient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we develop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical experts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show that fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations from 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant information. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4 when prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative evaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows very good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common quantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.

However, formulating realistic policies for robots demands responses from humans to an extensive array of queries. In this work, we approach the sample-efficiency challenge by expanding the information collected per query to contain both preferences and optional text prompting. To accomplish this, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to reason from the text provided by humans. To accommodate the additional query information, we reformulate the reward learning objectives to contain flexible highlights -- state-action pairs that contain relatively high information and are related to the features processed in a zero-shot fashion from a pretrained LLM. In both a simulated scenario and a user study, we reveal the effectiveness of our work by analyzing the feedback and its implications. Additionally, the collective feedback collected serves to train a robot on socially compliant trajectories in a simulated social navigation landscape.

|**2024-02-23**|**Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models**|Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in large language models are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor (which can repair up to 30% of the direct effect) and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair. et.al.|[2402.15390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15390)|**[link](https://github.com/starship006/backup_research)**|

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities (e.g., mobility, manipulation, and sensing) at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission performance and safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized LLM-based planner that is capable of achieving high mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on multi-robot home service applications. We also show through comparative experiments, that our method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized multi-robot LLM-based planners in terms of in terms of its ability to design correct plans.

However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention. et.al.|[2402.14808](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14808)|null|

These programs face two important challenges: efficiently allocating limited health resources to large beneficiary populations, and adapting to evolving policy priorities. While prior works in restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) demonstrated success in public health allocation tasks, they lack flexibility to adapt to evolving policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept, automated planners in various domains, including robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose DLM: a Decision Language Model for RMABs. To enable dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies for challenging public health settings using human-language commands, we propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose code reward functions for a multi-agent RL environment for RMABs, and (3) iterate on the generated reward using feedback from RMAB simulations to effectively adapt policy outcomes. In collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based public health organization promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, we conduct a simulation study, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human language commands as input. et.al.|[2402.14807](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14807)|null|

Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans. Yet many critiques question the applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when applied to LLMs. In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternate personality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluation method, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in the Likert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responses toward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learning model. We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor that outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs' responses. Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them to generate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess their personalities when playing two different roles. Using the external personality evaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs are significantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humans show a consistent personality profile in these two different situations. This shows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality in LLMs and humans. With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs. et.al.|[2402.14805](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14805)|null|

Different from previous weight pruning methods that rely on specifically designed hardware, this paper mainly aims to enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs by introducing plug-and-play expert-level sparsification techniques.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in IT, when an LLM is instruction-tuned on English-only data and then tested on user prompts in other languages. We investigate the influence of model configuration choices and devise a multi-facet evaluation strategy for multilingual instruction following. We find that cross-lingual transfer does happen successfully in IT even if all stages of model training are English-centric, but only if multiliguality is taken into account in hyperparameter tuning and with large enough IT data. English-trained LLMs are capable of generating correct-language, comprehensive and helpful responses in the other languages, but suffer from low factuality and may occasionally have fluency errors. et.al.|[2402.14778](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14778)|null|
|**2024-02-22**|**DualFocus: Integrating Macro and Micro Perspectives in Multi-modal Large Language Models**|We present DualFocus, a novel framework for integrating macro and micro perspectives within multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance vision-language task performance. Current MLLMs typically singularly focus on inputs at a predefined resolution, resulting in deficiencies in detailed questions involving local regions. We introduced a DualFocus mechanism where the model concentrates on the image from a macro perspective, responses to the question, and identifies suitable sub-regions to zoom in for subsequent micro perspective analysis. Via the integration of answers from both macro and micro perspectives, the model is adept at addressing tasks that encompass global, detailed, and combined considerations. To endows the DualFocus mechanism in MLLMs, we curated a tailored dataset derived from the Visual Genome (VG) and adapted it to align with the training regimen of DualFocus. Through comparative studies across different model sizes and benchmarks, we demonstrate DualFocus's superiority in balancing detailed examination with holistic insight, significantly reducing hallucination instances in MLLMs and improving their performance in various vision-language tasks. et.al.|[2402.14767](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14767)|**[link](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main/projects/DualFocus)**|
|**2024-02-22**|**MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues**|The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drastically enhanced dialogue systems. However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities. et.al.|[2402.14762](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14762)|null|
|**2024-02-22**|**Generalizing Reward Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Preference Learning**|Preference learning (PL) with large language models (LLMs) aims to align the LLMs' generations with human preferences. Previous work on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated promising results in in-distribution PL. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining human feedback, discretely training reward models for every encountered distribution is challenging. Thus, out-of-distribution (OOD) PL is practically useful for enhancing the generalization ability of LLMs with limited preference feedback. This work addresses OOD PL by optimizing a general reward model through a meta-learning approach. During meta-training, a bilevel optimization algorithm is utilized to learn a reward model capable of guiding policy learning to align with human preferences across various distributions. When encountering a test distribution, the meta-test procedure conducts regularized policy optimization using the learned reward model for PL. We theoretically demonstrate the convergence rate of the bilevel optimization algorithm under reasonable assumptions. Additionally, we conduct experiments on two text generation tasks across 20 held-out domains and outperform a variety of strong baselines across various evaluation metrics. et.al.|[2402.14760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14760)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**Coercing LLMs to do and reveal (almost) anything**|It has recently been shown that adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs) can "jailbreak" the model into making harmful statements. In this work, we argue that the spectrum of adversarial attacks on LLMs is much larger than merely jailbreaking. We provide a broad overview of possible attack surfaces and attack goals. Based on a series of concrete examples, we discuss, categorize and systematize attacks that coerce varied unintended behaviors, such as misdirection, model control, denial-of-service, or data extraction.   We analyze these attacks in controlled experiments, and find that many of them stem from the practice of pre-training LLMs with coding capabilities, as well as the continued existence of strange "glitch" tokens in common LLM vocabularies that should be removed for security reasons. et.al.|[2402.14020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14020)|**[link](https://github.com/jonasgeiping/carving)**|

Investigating Universal Adversarial Attacks on Zero-shot LLM Assessment**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful zero-shot assessors and are increasingly used in real-world situations such as for written exams or benchmarking systems. Despite this, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs against adversaries attempting to manipulate outputs. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we search for short universal phrases that when appended to texts can deceive LLMs to provide high assessment scores. Experiments on SummEval and TopicalChat demonstrate that both LLM-scoring and pairwise LLM-comparative assessment are vulnerable to simple concatenation attacks, where in particular LLM-scoring is very susceptible and can yield maximum assessment scores irrespective of the input text quality. Interestingly, such attacks are transferable and phrases learned on smaller open-source LLMs can be applied to larger closed-source models, such as GPT3.5. This highlights the pervasive nature of the adversarial vulnerabilities across different judge-LLM sizes, families and methods. Our findings raise significant concerns on the reliability of LLMs-as-a-judge methods, and underscore the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment in high-stakes real-world scenarios. et.al.|[2402.14016](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14016)|null|

With traditional benchmarks becoming less challenging for these models, new rigorous challenges are essential to gauge their advanced abilities. In this work, we present OlympiadBench, an Olympiad-level bilingual multimodal scientific benchmark, featuring 8,952 problems from Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competitions, including the Chinese college entrance exam. Each problem is detailed with expert-level annotations for step-by-step reasoning. Evaluating top-tier models on OlympiadBench, we implement a comprehensive assessment methodology to accurately evaluate model responses. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4V, attains an average score of 17.23% on OlympiadBench, with a mere 11.28% in physics, highlighting the benchmark rigor and the intricacy of physical reasoning. Our analysis orienting GPT-4V points out prevalent issues with hallucinations, knowledge omissions, and logical fallacies. We hope that our challenging benchmark can serve as a valuable resource for helping future AGI research endeavors. et.al.|[2402.14008](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14008)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**Can Watermarks Survive Translation? On the Cross-lingual Consistency of Text Watermark for Large Language Models**|Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. In this study, we introduce the concept of ''cross-lingual consistency'' in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages. Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages. Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. CWRA can effectively remove watermarks by reducing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.95 to 0.67 without performance loss. Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose a defense method that increases the AUC from 0.67 to 0.88 under CWRA. et.al.|[2402.14007](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14007)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**Hallucinations or Attention Misdirection? The Path to Strategic Value Extraction in Business Using Large Language Models**|Large Language Models with transformer architecture have revolutionized the domain of text generation, setting unprecedented benchmarks. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been criticized for generating outcomes that deviate from factual accuracy or display logical inconsistencies, phenomena commonly referred to as hallucinations. This term, however, has often been misapplied to any results deviating from the instructor's expectations, which this paper defines as attention misdirection rather than true hallucinations. Understanding the distinction between hallucinations and attention misdirection becomes increasingly relevant in business contexts, where the ramifications of such errors can significantly impact the value extraction from these inherently pre-trained models. This paper highlights the best practices of the PGI, Persona, Grouping, and Intelligence, method, a strategic framework that achieved a remarkable error rate of only 3,15 percent across 4,000 responses generated by GPT in response to a real business challenge. It emphasizes that by equipping experimentation with knowledge, businesses can unlock opportunities for innovation through the use of these natively pre-trained models. This reinforces the notion that strategic application grounded in a skilled team can maximize the benefits of emergent technologies such as the LLMs. et.al.|[2402.14002](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14002)|null|

In general, we present the contribution from the following aspects: first, for multilingual medical-specific adaptation, we construct a new multilingual medical corpus, that contains approximately 25.5B tokens encompassing 6 main languages, termed as MMedC, that enables auto-regressive training for existing general LLMs. second, to monitor the development of multilingual LLMs in medicine, we propose a new multilingual medical multi-choice question-answering benchmark with rationale, termed as MMedBench; third, we have assessed a number of popular, opensource large language models (LLMs) on our benchmark, along with those further auto-regressive trained on MMedC, as a result, our final model, termed as MMedLM 2, with only 7B parameters, achieves superior performance compared to all other open-source models, even rivaling GPT-4 on MMedBench.

|**2024-02-21**|**Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**|Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when asked to reason step-by-step before answering a question. However, it is unclear to what degree the model's final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning. et.al.|[2402.13950](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13950)|null|

In our study, we shift the focus to how even safe text coming from LLMs can be easily turned into potentially dangerous content through Bait-and-Switch attacks. In such attacks, the user first prompts LLMs with safe questions and then employs a simple find-and-replace post-hoc technique to manipulate the outputs into harmful narratives. The alarming efficacy of this approach in generating toxic content highlights a significant challenge in developing reliable safety guardrails for LLMs. In particular, we stress that focusing on the safety of the verbatim LLM outputs is insufficient and that we also need to consider post-hoc transformations. et.al.|[2402.13926](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13926)|null|

To counter the high costs and limited availability of expert-annotated data for factual alignment, this study introduces an innovative pipeline that utilizes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate high-quality feedback aimed at enhancing factual consistency in clinical note summarization. Our research primarily focuses on edit feedback, mirroring the practical scenario in which medical professionals refine AI system outputs without the need for additional annotations. Despite GPT's proven expertise in various clinical NLP tasks, such as the Medical Licensing Examination, there is scant research on its capacity to deliver expert-level edit feedback for improving weaker LMs or LLMs generation quality. This work leverages GPT's advanced capabilities in clinical NLP to offer expert-level edit feedback. Through the use of two distinct alignment algorithms (DPO and SALT) based on GPT edit feedback, our goal is to reduce hallucinations and align closely with medical facts, endeavoring to narrow the divide between AI-generated content and factual accuracy. This highlights the substantial potential of GPT edits in enhancing the alignment of clinical factuality. et.al.|[2402.13919](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13919)|null|
|**2024-02-21**|**What Linguistic Features and Languages are Important in LLM Translation?**|Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capability across multiple tasks, including machine translation. Our study focuses on evaluating Llama2's machine translation capabilities and exploring how translation depends on languages in its training data. Our experiments show that the 7B Llama2 model yields above 10 BLEU score for all languages it has seen, but not always for languages it has not seen. Most gains for those unseen languages are observed the most with the model scale compared to using chat versions or adding shot count. Furthermore, our linguistic distance analysis reveals that syntactic similarity is not always the primary linguistic factor in determining translation quality. Interestingly, we discovered that under specific circumstances, some languages, despite having significantly less training data than English, exhibit strong correlations comparable to English. Our discoveries here give new perspectives for the current landscape of LLMs, raising the possibility that LLMs centered around languages other than English may offer a more effective foundation for a multilingual model. et.al.|[2402.13917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13917)|null|

We demonstrate a semantic search framework that achieves a comprehensive semantic understanding of the entire notebook's contents, enabling it to effectively handle various types of user queries. Key components of this framework include:   1). A data preprocessor is designed to handle diverse types of cells within Jupyter Notebooks, encompassing both markdown and code cells. 2).

|**2024-02-20**|**Investigating Cultural Alignment of Large Language Models**|The intricate relationship between language and culture has long been a subject of exploration within the realm of linguistic anthropology. Large Language Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge, raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverse knowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these models demonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions -- firstly, when prompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, when pretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. We quantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing model responses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically, we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the United States through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in both Arabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the survey questions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronounced for underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such as those probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, a novel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance cultural alignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingual pretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience and the plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic of cross-lingual transfer. et.al.|[2402.13231](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13231)|**[link](https://github.com/bkhmsi/cultural-trends)**|
|**2024-02-20**|**Smaug: Fixing Failure Modes of Preference Optimisation with DPO-Positive**|Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, and alignment. Using pairs of preferred and dispreferred data, DPO models the \textit{relative} probability of picking one response over another. In this work, first we show theoretically that the standard DPO loss can lead to a \textit{reduction} of the model's likelihood of the preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between the preferred and dispreferred classes increases. We then show empirically that this phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especially datasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low. Using these insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and training procedure which avoids this failure mode. Surprisingly, we also find that DPOP significantly outperforms DPO across a wide variety of datasets and downstream tasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions. By fine-tuning with DPOP, we create and release Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, which achieve state-of-the-art open-source performance. Notably, Smaug-72B is nearly 2\% better than any other open-source model on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and becomes the first open-source LLM to surpass an average accuracy of 80\%. et.al.|[2402.13228](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13228)|null|

Nevertheless, their widespread utilization is frequently hindered by usability challenges, poor dissemination, and restricted functionality. Augmenting large language models with extensive collections of clinical calculators presents an opportunity to overcome these obstacles and improve workflow efficiency, but the scalability of the manual curation process poses a significant challenge. In response, we introduce AgentMD, a novel language agent capable of curating and applying clinical calculators across various clinical contexts. Using the published literature, AgentMD has automatically curated a collection of 2,164 diverse clinical calculators with executable functions and structured documentation, collectively named RiskCalcs. Manual evaluations show that RiskCalcs tools achieve an accuracy of over 80% on three quality metrics. At inference time, AgentMD can automatically select and apply the relevant RiskCalcs tools given any patient description. On the newly established RiskQA benchmark, AgentMD significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4 (87.7% vs. 40.9% in accuracy). Additionally, we also applied AgentMD to real-world clinical notes for analyzing both population-level and risk-level patient characteristics. In summary, our study illustrates the utility of language agents augmented with clinical calculators for healthcare analytics and patient care. et.al.|[2402.13225](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13225)|null|

However, the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English, the de facto prompting language. Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task, even for the most advanced LLMs. Currently, there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English. In this work, we present RoCode, a competitive programming dataset, consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models.

An Empirical Analysis on Deceptive Prompts**|The remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not rendered them immune to challenges, particularly in the context of handling deceptive information in prompts, thus producing hallucinated responses under such conditions. To quantitatively assess this vulnerability, we present MAD-Bench, a carefully curated benchmark that contains 850 test samples divided into 6 categories, such as non-existent objects, count of objects, spatial relationship, and visual confusion. We provide a comprehensive analysis of popular MLLMs, ranging from GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, to open-sourced models, such as LLaVA-1.5 and CogVLM. Empirically, we observe significant performance gaps between GPT-4V and other models; and previous robust instruction-tuned models, such as LRV-Instruction and LLaVA-RLHF, are not effective on this new benchmark. While GPT-4V achieves 75.02% accuracy on MAD-Bench, the accuracy of any other model in our experiments ranges from 5% to 35%. We further propose a remedy that adds an additional paragraph to the deceptive prompts to encourage models to think twice before answering the question. Surprisingly, this simple method can even double the accuracy; however, the absolute numbers are still too low to be satisfactory. We hope MAD-Bench can serve as a valuable benchmark to stimulate further research to enhance models' resilience against deceptive prompts. et.al.|[2402.13220](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13220)|null|
|**2024-02-20**|**Softmax Probabilities (Mostly) Predict Large Language Model Correctness on Multiple-Choice Q&A**|Although large language models (LLMs) perform impressively on many tasks, overconfidence remains a problem. We hypothesized that on multiple-choice Q&A tasks, wrong answers would be associated with smaller maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) compared to correct answers. We comprehensively evaluate this hypothesis on ten open-source LLMs and five datasets, and find strong evidence for our hypothesis among models which perform well on the original Q&A task. For the six LLMs with the best Q&A performance, the AUROC derived from the MSP was better than random chance with p < 10^{-4} in 59/60 instances. Among those six LLMs, the average AUROC ranged from 60% to 69%. Leveraging these findings, we propose a multiple-choice Q&A task with an option to abstain and show that performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response. We also run the same experiments with pre-softmax logits instead of softmax probabilities and find similar (but not identical) results. et.al.|[2402.13213](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13213)|**[link](https://github.com/bplaut/softmax-probs-predict-llm-correctness)**|
|**2024-02-20**|**Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Model Agents**|Generations from large language models (LLMs) can be improved by sampling and scoring multiple solutions to select a final answer. Current "sample and select" methods such as self-consistency (SC) rely on majority voting to score answers. However, when tasks have many distinct and valid answers, selection by voting requires a large number of samples. This makes SC prohibitively expensive for interactive tasks that involve generating multiple actions (answers) sequentially. After establishing that majority voting fails to provide consistent gains on such tasks, we demonstrate how to increase success rates by softening the scoring criterion. We introduce Soft Self-Consistency (Soft-SC), which replaces SC's discontinuous scoring with a continuous score computed from model likelihoods, allowing for selection even when actions are sparsely distributed. Soft-SC improves both performance and efficiency on long-horizon interactive tasks, requiring half as many samples as SC for comparable or better performance. For a fixed number of samples, Soft-SC leads to a 1.3% increase over SC in absolute success rate on writing bash programs, a 6.6% increase on online shopping (WebShop), and a 4.7% increase for an interactive household game (ALFWorld). Finally, we show that Soft-SC can be applied to both open-source and black-box models. et.al.|[2402.13212](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13212)|**[link](https://github.com/hannight/soft_self_consistency)**|
|**2024-02-20**|**Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter? Mitigating Preference Bias on Emotional Support Conversation**|Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) is a task aimed at alleviating individuals' emotional distress through daily conversation. Given its inherent complexity and non-intuitive nature, ESConv dataset incorporates support strategies to facilitate the generation of appropriate responses. Recently, despite the remarkable conversational ability of large language models (LLMs), previous studies have suggested that they often struggle with providing useful emotional support. Hence, this work initially analyzes the results of LLMs on ESConv, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a notable preference for a specific strategy. Motivated by these, we explore the impact of the inherent preference in LLMs on providing emotional support, and consequently, we observe that exhibiting high preference for specific strategies hinders effective emotional support, aggravating its robustness in predicting the appropriate strategy. Moreover, we conduct a methodological study to offer insights into the necessary approaches for LLMs to serve as proficient emotional supporters. Our findings emphasize that (1) low preference for specific strategies hinders the progress of emotional support, (2) external assistance helps reduce preference bias, and (3) LLMs alone cannot become good emotional supporters. These insights suggest promising avenues for future research to enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs. et.al.|[2402.13211](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13211)|null|
|**2024-02-20**|**Bayesian Reward Models for LLM Alignment**|To ensure that large language model (LLM) responses are helpful and non-toxic, we usually fine-tune a reward model on human preference data. We then select policy responses with high rewards (best-of-n sampling) or further optimize the policy to produce responses with high rewards (reinforcement learning from human feedback). However, this process is vulnerable to reward overoptimization or hacking, in which the responses selected have high rewards due to errors in the reward model rather than a genuine preference. This is especially problematic as the prompt or response diverges from the training data. It should be possible to mitigate these issues by training a Bayesian reward model, which signals higher uncertainty further from the training data distribution. Therefore, we trained Bayesian reward models using Laplace-LoRA (Yang et al., 2024) and found that the resulting uncertainty estimates can successfully mitigate reward overoptimization in best-of-n sampling. et.al.|[2402.13210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13210)|null|

While speculative decoding has recently emerged as a promising direction for speeding up inference, existing methods are limited in their ability to scale to larger speculation budgets, and adapt to different hyperparameters and hardware. This paper introduces Sequoia, a scalable, robust, and hardware-aware algorithm for speculative decoding. To attain better scalability, Sequoia introduces a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal tree structure for the speculated tokens. To achieve robust speculative performance, Sequoia uses a novel sampling and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding temperatures. Finally, Sequoia introduces a hardware-aware tree optimizer that maximizes speculative performance by automatically selecting the token tree size and depth for a given hardware platform. Evaluation shows that Sequoia improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B on an A100 by up to $4.04\times$, $3.84\times$, and $2.37\times$, and Llama2-70B offloading by up to $10.33\times$ on L40. et.al.|[2402.12374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12374)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**A Critical Evaluation of AI Feedback for Aligning Large Language Models**|Reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF) is a popular paradigm for improving the instruction-following abilities of powerful pre-trained language models. RLAIF first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using demonstrations from a teacher model and then further fine-tunes the model with reinforcement learning (RL), using feedback from a critic model. While recent popular open-source models have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance from the RL step, in this paper we question whether the complexity of this RL step is truly warranted for AI feedback. We show that the improvements of the RL step are virtually entirely due to the widespread practice of using a weaker teacher model (e.g. GPT-3.5) for SFT data collection than the critic (e.g., GPT-4) used for AI feedback generation. Specifically, we show that simple supervised fine-tuning with GPT-4 as the teacher outperforms existing RLAIF pipelines. More generally, we find that the gains from RLAIF vary substantially across base model families, test-time evaluation protocols, and critic models.

Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones. In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem). Surfacing new associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases, with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of the biomedical scientific production. To overcome this challenge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets. RAG methods typically select the context via maximum similarity search over text embeddings. In this study, we show that RAG methods leave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters of over-represented concepts in the biomedical literature. We introduce a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample these clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. Its retrieval performance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combined into a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements to biomedical question-answering models. et.al.|[2402.12352](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12352)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**GTBench: Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Limitations of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. et.al.|[2402.12348](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12348)|**[link](https://github.com/jinhaoduan/gtbench)**|

However, in this work, we introduce an inference-time attack framework, demonstrating that safety alignment can also unintentionally facilitate harmful outcomes under adversarial manipulation. This framework, named Emulated Disalignment (ED), adversely combines a pair of open-source pre-trained and safety-aligned language models in the output space to produce a harmful language model without any training. Our experiments with ED across three datasets and four model families (Llama-1, Llama-2, Mistral, and Alpaca) show that ED doubles the harmfulness of pre-trained models and outperforms strong baselines, achieving the highest harmful rate in 43 out of 48 evaluation subsets by a large margin. Crucially, our findings highlight the importance of reevaluating the practice of open-sourcing language models even after safety alignment. et.al.|[2402.12343](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12343)|null|

However, the potential for LLM agents to spontaneously establish collaborative relationships in the absence of explicit instructions has not been studied. To address this gap, we conduct three case studies, revealing that LLM agents are capable of spontaneously forming collaborations even within competitive settings. This finding not only demonstrates the capacity of LLM agents to mimic competition and cooperation in human societies but also validates a promising vision of computational social science. Specifically, it suggests that LLM agents could be utilized to model human social interactions, including those with spontaneous collaborations, thus offering insights into social phenomena.

|**2024-02-19**|**ARKS: Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup for Code Generation**|Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm has raised much attention for its potential in incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) without further training. While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code. In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets. We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup. To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages. Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.

|**2024-02-19**|**Is Open-Source There Yet? A Comparative Study on Commercial and Open-Source LLMs in Their Ability to Label Chest X-Ray Reports**|Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models. While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used. The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively. On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4. This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification. et.al.|[2402.12298](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12298)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**Adaptive Skeleton Graph Decoding**|Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant adoption for natural language tasks, owing their success to massive numbers of model parameters (e.g., 70B+); however, LLM inference incurs significant computation and memory costs. Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality. Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance. In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems. Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality. Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%. et.al.|[2402.12280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12280)|null|
|**2024-02-19**|**Explain then Rank: Scale Calibration of Neural Rankers Using Natural Language Explanations from Large Language Models**|The process of scale calibration in ranking systems involves adjusting the outputs of rankers to correspond with significant qualities like click-through rates or relevance, crucial for mirroring real-world value and thereby boosting the system's effectiveness and reliability. Although there has been research on calibrated ranking losses within learning-to-rank models, the particular issue of adjusting the scale for neural rankers, which excel in handling textual information, has not been thoroughly examined. Neural ranking models are adept at processing text data, yet the application of existing scale calibration techniques to these models poses significant challenges due to their complexity and the intensive training they require, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes.   This study delves into the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide uncertainty measurements for a query and document pair that correlate with the scale-calibrated scores. By employing Monte Carlo sampling to gauge relevance probabilities from LLMs and incorporating natural language explanations (NLEs) to articulate this uncertainty, we carry out comprehensive tests on two major document ranking datasets. Our findings reveal that the approach leveraging NLEs outperforms existing calibration methods under various training scenarios, leading to better calibrated neural rankers. et.al.|[2402.12276](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12276)|**[link](https://github.com/pxyu/llm-nle-for-calibration)**|
|**2024-02-16**|**PaLM2-VAdapter: Progressively Aligned Language Model Makes a Strong Vision-language Adapter**|This paper demonstrates that a progressively aligned language model can effectively bridge frozen vision encoders and large language models (LLMs). While the fundamental architecture and pre-training methods of vision encoders and LLMs have been extensively studied, the architecture and training strategy of vision-language adapters vary significantly across recent works. Our research undertakes a thorough exploration of the state-of-the-art perceiver resampler architecture and builds a strong baseline. However, we observe that the vision-language alignment with perceiver resampler exhibits slow convergence and limited scalability with a lack of direct supervision. To address this issue, we propose PaLM2-VAdapter, employing a progressively aligned language model as the vision-language adapter. Compared to the strong baseline with perceiver resampler, our method empirically shows faster convergence, higher performance, and stronger scalability. Extensive experiments across various Visual Question Answering (VQA) and captioning tasks on both images and videos demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art visual understanding and multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Notably, our method achieves these advancements with 30~70% fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art large vision-language models, marking a significant efficiency improvement. et.al.|[2402.10896](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10896)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**RLVF: Learning from Verbal Feedback without Overgeneralization**|The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences. A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as "Don't use emojis when drafting emails to my boss." However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to overgeneralization of the feedback to contexts where it is not relevant. We study the problem of incorporating verbal feedback without such overgeneralization, inspiring a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO). C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset specifying how the feedback should (and should not) be applied. It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply. Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts. For both human- and GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%. et.al.|[2402.10893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10893)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**Instruction Diversity Drives Generalization To Unseen Tasks**|Instruction tuning -- fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on pairs of instructions and desired outcomes -- is an approach that enables pre-trained language models to perform real-world tasks and follow human instructions. Its practical success depends on the model learning a broader set of instructions than those it was trained on. Yet the factors that determine model generalization to such \emph{unseen tasks} are not well understood. %To understand the driving factors of generalization, In this paper, we experiment with string rewrites, a symbolic task that serves as a building block for Turing complete Markov algorithms while allowing experimental control of "inputs" and "instructions". We investigate the trade-off between the number of instructions the model is trained on and the number of training samples provided for each instruction and observe that the diversity of the instruction set determines generalization. Generalization emerges once a diverse enough set of tasks is provided, even though very few examples are provided for each task. Instruction diversity also ensures robustness with respect to non-uniform distributions of instructions in the training set. et.al.|[2402.10891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10891)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the Discriminator**|In this paper, we examine how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency. For example, compared to the other two methods, tree search is at least 10--20 times slower but leads to negligible performance gains, which hinders its real-world applications.

|**2024-02-16**|**Multi-modal preference alignment remedies regression of visual instruction tuning on language model**|In production, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets which the underlying language model had been trained with. To address this challenging degradation, we first collect a lightweight (6k entries) VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for 5 quality metrics in a granular fashion, and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and SteerLM. Our findings indicate that the with DPO we are able to surpass instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99 despite small data scale. This enhancement in textual instruction proficiency correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\% on MM-Vet, +6\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that reconciles the textual and visual performance of MLLMs, restoring and boosting language capability after visual instruction tuning. et.al.|[2402.10884](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10884)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**EcoRank: Budget-Constrained Text Re-ranking Using Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text re-ranking. This process includes queries and candidate passages in the prompts, utilizing pointwise, listwise, and pairwise prompting strategies. A limitation of these ranking strategies with LLMs is their cost: the process can become expensive due to API charges, which are based on the number of input and output tokens. We study how to maximize the re-ranking performance given a budget, by navigating the vast search spaces of prompt choices, LLM APIs, and budget splits. We propose a suite of budget-constrained methods to perform text re-ranking using a set of LLM APIs. Our most efficient method, called EcoRank, is a two-layered pipeline that jointly optimizes decisions regarding budget allocation across prompt strategies and LLM APIs. Our experimental results on four popular QA and passage reranking datasets show that EcoRank outperforms other budget-aware supervised and unsupervised baselines. et.al.|[2402.10866](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10866)|null|

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently received a boost from LLMs. However, there is a research gap in the LLMs' preferences in this field. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional models, many properties of LLMs in time series prediction are found. For example, our study shows that LLMs excel in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. We explain our findings through designing prompts to require LLMs to tell the period of the datasets. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases positively affects the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, this study contributes to insight into the advantages and limitations of LLMs in time series forecasting under different conditions. et.al.|[2402.10835](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10835)|null|

Hence, explainability plays a critical role in trustworthy autonomous decision-making to foster transparency and acceptance among end users, especially in complex autonomous driving. Recent advancements in Multi-Modal Large Language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in enhancing the explainability as a driving agent by producing control predictions along with natural language explanations. However, severe data scarcity due to expensive annotation costs and significant domain gaps between different datasets makes the development of a robust and generalisable system an extremely challenging task. Moreover, the prohibitively expensive training requirements of MLLM and the unsolved problem of catastrophic forgetting further limit their generalisability post-deployment. To address these challenges, we present RAG-Driver, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-modal large language model that leverages in-context learning for high-performance, explainable, and generalisable autonomous driving. By grounding in retrieved expert demonstration, we empirically validate that RAG-Driver achieves state-of-the-art performance in producing driving action explanations, justifications, and control signal prediction. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional zero-shot generalisation capabilities to unseen environments without further training endeavours. et.al.|[2402.10828](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10828)|null|

In this study, we delve into the intersection of persona variables and the capability of LLMs to simulate different perspectives. We find that persona variables can explain <10\% variance in annotations in existing subjective NLP datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating them via prompting in LLMs provides modest improvement. Persona prompting is most effective on data samples where disagreements among annotators are frequent yet confined to a limited range. A linear correlation exists: the more persona variables influence human annotations, the better LLMs predictions are using persona prompting. However, when the utility of persona variables is low (i.e., explaining <10\% of human annotations), persona prompting has little effect. Most subjective NLP datasets fall into this category, casting doubt on simulating diverse perspectives in the current NLP landscape. et.al.|[2402.10811](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10811)|null|
|**2024-02-16**|**Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval: Memorizing Images in Multimodal Language Models for Retrieval and Beyond**|The recent advancements in generative language models have demonstrated their ability to memorize knowledge from documents and recall knowledge to respond to user queries effectively. Building upon this capability, we propose to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to memorize and recall images within their parameters. Given a user query for visual content, the MLLM is anticipated to "recall" the relevant image from its parameters as the response. Achieving this target presents notable challenges, including inbuilt visual memory and visual recall schemes within MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce a generative cross-modal retrieval framework, which assigns unique identifier strings to represent images and involves two training steps: learning to memorize and learning to retrieve. The first step focuses on training the MLLM to memorize the association between images and their respective identifiers. The latter step teaches the MLLM to generate the corresponding identifier of the target image, given the textual query input. By memorizing images in MLLMs, we introduce a new paradigm to cross-modal retrieval, distinct from previous discriminative approaches. The experiments demonstrate that the generative paradigm performs effectively and efficiently even with large-scale image candidate sets. et.al.|[2402.10805](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10805)|null|

While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images ("winner" and "loser" images) for each text prompt. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data. et.al.|[2402.10210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10210)|null|
|**2024-02-15**|**Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment**|We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around $10\%$ GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline. et.al.|[2402.10207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207)|null|
|**2024-02-15**|**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting**|In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top- $k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding. et.al.|[2402.10200](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200)|null|

Their capability of using language as a vehicle for thought and communication lends an incredible level of flexibility and versatility. People have quickly capitalized on this capability to connect LLMs to a wide range of external components and environments: databases, tools, the Internet, robotic embodiment, etc. Many believe an unprecedentedly powerful automation technology is emerging. However, new automation technologies come with new safety risks, especially for intricate systems like language agents. There is a surprisingly large gap between the speed and scale of their development and deployment and our understanding of their safety risks. Are we building a house of cards? In this position paper, we present the first systematic effort in mapping adversarial attacks against language agents. We first present a unified conceptual framework for agents with three major components: Perception, Brain, and Action. Under this framework, we present a comprehensive discussion and propose 12 potential attack scenarios against different components of an agent, covering different attack strategies (e.g., input manipulation, adversarial demonstrations, jailbreaking, backdoors). We also draw connections to successful attack strategies previously applied to LLMs. We emphasize the urgency to gain a thorough understanding of language agent risks before their widespread deployment. et.al.|[2402.10196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10196)|**[link](https://github.com/osu-nlp-group/agentattack)**|
|**2024-02-15**|**BitDelta: Your Fine-Tune May Only Be Worth One Bit**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible. We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta. We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance. This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models. By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings. et.al.|[2402.10193](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10193)|**[link](https://github.com/FasterDecoding/BitDelta)**|

However, trustworthy issues with LLM's response, such as hallucination, have also been actively discussed. Existing works have been devoted to quantifying the uncertainty in LLM's response, but they often overlook the complex nature of LLMs and the uniqueness of in-context learning. In this work, we delve into the predictive uncertainty of LLMs associated with in-context learning, highlighting that such uncertainties may stem from both the provided demonstrations (aleatoric uncertainty) and ambiguities tied to the model's configurations (epistemic uncertainty). We propose a novel formulation and corresponding estimation method to quantify both types of uncertainties. The proposed method offers an unsupervised way to understand the prediction of in-context learning in a plug-and-play fashion.

Here we aim to mitigate such incompatibility through the design of dataset information structures during reward modeling. Specifically, we first reexamine the RLHF process and propose a theoretical framework portraying it as an autoencoding process over text distributions. Our framework formalizes the RLHF objective of ensuring distributional consistency between human preference and large language model (LLM) behavior. Building on this framework, we then systematically investigate the performance impact of information structure in the reward modeling stage of RLHF. To further understand reward generalization in the reward modeling stage, we introduce a new method based on random graph theory that models generalization in the semantic space. A key insight of our analysis is the superiority of the tree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-based baselines adopted by conventional RLHF methods. We derive that under highly complex contexts with limited data, the tree-based reward model (RM) induces up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times less variance than chain-based RM where $n$ is the dataset size. To validate our theoretical contribution, we demonstrate that on three different NLP tasks, the tree-based RM achieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines. Looking forward, we hope our framework can serve as a step towards understanding goal misgeneralization. et.al.|[2402.10184](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184)|null|
|**2024-02-15**|**TDAG: A Multi-Agent Framework based on Dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation**|The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has inspired the development of LLM-based agents capable of addressing complex, real-world tasks. However, these agents often struggle during task execution due to methodological constraints, such as error propagation and limited adaptability. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent framework based on dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation (TDAG). This framework dynamically decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtasks and assigns each to a specifically generated subagent, thereby enhancing adaptability in diverse and unpredictable real-world tasks. Simultaneously, existing benchmarks often lack the granularity needed to evaluate incremental progress in complex, multi-step tasks. In response, we introduce ItineraryBench in the context of travel planning, featuring interconnected, progressively complex tasks with a fine-grained evaluation system. ItineraryBench is designed to assess agents' abilities in memory, planning, and tool usage across tasks of varying complexity. Our experimental results reveal that TDAG significantly outperforms established baselines, showcasing its superior adaptability and context awareness in complex task scenarios. et.al.|[2402.10178](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10178)|null|
|**2024-02-15**|**OpenMathInstruct-1: A 1.8 Million Math Instruction Tuning Dataset**|Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models.

When it comes to long-form text generation, there has been a growing interest in generation from a discourse coherence perspective. However, existing lexical or semantic metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BertScore cannot effectively capture the discourse coherence. The development of discourse-specific automatic evaluation methods for assessing the output of LLMs warrants greater focus and exploration. In this paper, we present a novel automatic metric designed to quantify the discourse divergence between two long-form articles. Extensive experiments on three datasets from representative domains demonstrate that our metric aligns more closely with human preferences and GPT-4 coherence evaluation, outperforming existing evaluation methods. et.al.|[2402.10175](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10175)|**[link](https://github.com/williamlyh/pos_div_metric)**|

The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 12 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance. (3) A very limited number of predecessor steps following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.

|**2024-02-14**|**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Active Queries**|Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method. et.al.|[2402.09401](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09401)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**Get More with LESS: Synthesizing Recurrence with KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference**|Many computational factors limit broader deployment of large language models. In this paper, we focus on a memory bottleneck imposed by the key-value (KV) cache, a computational shortcut that requires storing previous KV pairs during decoding. While existing KV cache methods approach this problem by pruning or evicting large swaths of relatively less important KV pairs to dramatically reduce the memory footprint of the cache, they can have limited success in tasks that require recollecting a majority of previous tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose LESS, a simple integration of a (nearly free) constant sized cache with eviction-based cache methods, such that all tokens can be queried at later decoding steps. Its ability to retain information throughout time shows merit on a variety of tasks where we demonstrate LESS can help reduce the performance gap from caching everything, sometimes even matching it, all while being efficient. et.al.|[2402.09398](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09398)|null|

In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 across all the tasks by a substantial margin and approaching the SoTA task-specific models. The key to our success is a large-scale, comprehensive, high-quality dataset for instruction tuning named SMolInstruct. It contains 14 meticulously selected chemistry tasks and over three million high-quality samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Based on SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. We further conduct analysis on the impact of trainable parameters, providing insights for future research. et.al.|[2402.09391](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09391)|**[link](https://github.com/osu-nlp-group/llm4chem)**|

To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments reveal that HGOT outperforms other retrieval-augmented in-context learning methods, including Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), ReAct, Self-Ask, and Retrieve-then-Read on different datasets by as much as $7\%$ , demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing the factuality of LLMs. et.al.|[2402.09390](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09390)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**Massively Multi-Cultural Knowledge Acquisition & LM Benchmarking**|Pretrained large language models have revolutionized many applications but still face challenges related to cultural bias and a lack of cultural commonsense knowledge crucial for guiding cross-culture communication and interactions. Recognizing the shortcomings of existing methods in capturing the diverse and rich cultures across the world, this paper introduces a novel approach for massively multicultural knowledge acquisition. Specifically, our method strategically navigates from densely informative Wikipedia documents on cultural topics to an extensive network of linked pages. Leveraging this valuable source of data collection, we construct the CultureAtlas dataset, which covers a wide range of sub-country level geographical regions and ethnolinguistic groups, with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure textual assertion sentence self-containment, as well as fine-grained cultural profile information extraction. Our dataset not only facilitates the evaluation of language model performance in culturally diverse contexts but also serves as a foundational tool for the development of culturally sensitive and aware language models. Our work marks an important step towards deeper understanding and bridging the gaps of cultural disparities in AI, to promote a more inclusive and balanced representation of global cultures in the digital domain. et.al.|[2402.09369](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09369)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**Copyright Traps for Large Language Models**|Questions of fair use of copyright-protected content to train Large Language Models (LLMs) are being very actively debated. Document-level inference has been proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trained model whether a piece of content has been seen during training. SOTA methods however rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content. While very effective against models that memorize a lot, we hypothesize--and later confirm--that they will not work against models that do not naturally memorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models. We here propose to use copyright traps, the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use of copyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization does not naturally occur. We carefully design an experimental setup, randomly inserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM. We first validate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectable using existing methods. We then show, contrary to intuition, that even medium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) are not detectable using existing methods. However, we show that longer sequences repeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and used as copyright traps. We further improve these results by studying how the number of times a sequence is seen improves detectability, how sequences with higher perplexity tend to be memorized more, and how taking context into account further improves detectability. et.al.|[2402.09363](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09363)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**HiRE: High Recall Approximate Top- $k$ Estimation for Efficient LLM Inference**|Autoregressive decoding with generative Large Language Models (LLMs) on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) is often memory-bound where most of the time is spent on transferring model parameters from high bandwidth memory (HBM) to cache. On the other hand, recent works show that LLMs can maintain quality with significant sparsity/redundancy in the feedforward (FFN) layers by appropriately training the model to operate on a top-$k$ fraction of rows/columns (where $k \approx 0.05$), there by suggesting a way to reduce the transfer of model parameters, and hence latency. However, exploiting this sparsity for improving latency is hindered by the fact that identifying top rows/columns is data-dependent and is usually performed using full matrix operations, severely limiting potential gains. To address these issues, we introduce HiRE (High Recall Approximate Top-k Estimation). HiRE comprises of two novel components: (i) a compression scheme to cheaply predict top-$k$ rows/columns with high recall, followed by full computation restricted to the predicted subset, and (ii) DA-TOP-$k$: an efficient multi-device approximate top-$k$ operator. We demonstrate that on a one billion parameter model, HiRE applied to both the softmax as well as feedforward layers, achieves almost matching pretraining and downstream accuracy, and speeds up inference latency by $1.47\times$ on a single TPUv5e device. et.al.|[2402.09360](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09360)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**Developing a Framework for Auditing Large Language Models Using Human-in-the-Loop**|As LLMs become more pervasive across various users and scenarios, identifying potential issues when using these models becomes essential. Examples include bias, inconsistencies, and hallucination. Although auditing the LLM for these problems is desirable, it is far from being easy or solved. An effective method is to probe the LLM using different versions of the same question. This could expose inconsistencies in its knowledge or operation, indicating potential for bias or hallucination. However, to operationalize this auditing method at scale, we need an approach to create those probes reliably and automatically. In this paper we propose an automatic and scalable solution, where one uses a different LLM along with human-in-the-loop. This approach offers verifiability and transparency, while avoiding circular reliance on the same LLMs, and increasing scientific rigor and generalizability. Specifically, we present a novel methodology with two phases of verification using humans: standardized evaluation criteria to verify responses, and a structured prompt template to generate desired probes. Experiments on a set of questions from TruthfulQA dataset show that we can generate a reliable set of probes from one LLM that can be used to audit inconsistencies in a different LLM. The criteria for generating and applying auditing probes is generalizable to various LLMs regardless of the underlying structure or training mechanism. et.al.|[2402.09346](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09346)|null|
|**2024-02-14**|**AuditLLM: A Tool for Auditing Large Language Models Using Multiprobe Approach**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption in various contexts, it becomes crucial to ensure they are reasonably safe, consistent, and reliable for an application at hand. This may require probing or auditing them. Probing LLMs with varied iterations of a single question could reveal potential inconsistencies in their knowledge or functionality. However, a tool for performing such audits with simple workflow and low technical threshold is lacking. In this demo, we introduce "AuditLLM," a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way. AuditLLM's core functionality lies in its ability to test a given LLM by auditing it using multiple probes generated from a single question, thereby identifying any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation. A reasonably robust, reliable, and consistent LLM should output semantically similar responses for a question asked differently or by different people. Based on this assumption, AuditLLM produces easily interpretable results regarding the LLM's consistencies from a single question that the user enters. A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues. One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM. To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis. This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform. et.al.|[2402.09334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09334)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability**|Jailbreaks on Large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent suffix attacks, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with minimal paraphrasing, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with left-right-coherence. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability.

|**2024-02-13**|**Human Curriculum Effects Emerge with In-Context Learning in Neural Networks**|Human learning is sensitive to rule-like structure and the curriculum of examples used for training. In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning is more robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absence of such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model has simultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects. Here we show that this same tradeoff spontaneously emerges with "in-context learning" (ICL) both in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models (LLMs). ICL is the ability to learn new tasks "in context" - without weight changes - via an inner-loop algorithm implemented in activation dynamics. Experiments with pretrained LLMs and metalearning transformers show that ICL exhibits the blocking advantage demonstrated in humans on a task involving rule-like structure, and conversely, that concurrent in-weight learning reproduces the interleaving advantage observed in humans on tasks lacking such structure. et.al.|[2402.08674](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08674)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**Improving Generalization in Semantic Parsing by Increasing Natural Language Variation**|Text-to-SQL semantic parsing has made significant progress in recent years, with various models demonstrating impressive performance on the challenging Spider benchmark. However, it has also been shown that these models often struggle to generalize even when faced with small perturbations of previously (accurately) parsed expressions. This is mainly due to the linguistic form of questions in Spider which are overly specific, unnatural, and display limited variation. In this work, we use data augmentation to enhance the robustness of text-to-SQL parsers against natural language variations. Existing approaches generate question reformulations either via models trained on Spider or only introduce local changes. In contrast, we leverage the capabilities of large language models to generate more realistic and diverse questions. Using only a few prompts, we achieve a two-fold increase in the number of questions in Spider. Training on this augmented dataset yields substantial improvements on a range of evaluation sets, including robustness benchmarks and out-of-domain data. et.al.|[2402.08666](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08666)|null|

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Issuing Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions: Fostering Physical Activity in a Prospective Cardiac Rehabilitation Setting**|We explored the viability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for triggering and personalizing content for Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAI implementation face scalability and reliability limitations, such as lack of personalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issues with data sparsity. To investigate JITAI implementation via LLMs, we tested the contemporary overall performance-leading model 'GPT-4' with examples grounded in the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Three personas and five sets of context information per persona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs. Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and message content, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with GPT-4, a baseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). Ratings from 27 LayPs indicated that JITAIs generated by GPT-4 were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessed scales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality. This study indicates that LLMs have significant potential for implementing JITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offering scalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampled information, and good acceptability. et.al.|[2402.08658](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08658)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**PIN: Positional Insert Unlocks Object Localisation Abilities in VLMs**|Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Flamingo and GPT-4V, have shown immense potential by integrating large language models with vision systems. Nevertheless, these models face challenges in the fundamental computer vision task of object localisation, due to their training on multimodal data containing mostly captions without explicit spatial grounding. While it is possible to construct custom, supervised training pipelines with bounding box annotations that integrate with VLMs, these result in specialized and hard-to-scale models. In this paper, we aim to explore the limits of caption-based VLMs and instead propose to tackle the challenge in a simpler manner by i) keeping the weights of a caption-based VLM frozen and ii) not using any supervised detection data. To this end, we introduce an input-agnostic Positional Insert (PIN), a learnable spatial prompt, containing a minimal set of parameters that are slid inside the frozen VLM, unlocking object localisation capabilities. Our PIN module is trained with a simple next-token prediction task on synthetic data without requiring the introduction of new output heads. Our experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot localisation performances on a variety of images, including Pascal VOC, COCO, LVIS, and diverse images like paintings or cartoons. et.al.|[2402.08657](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08657)|null|
|**2024-02-13**|**Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs**|The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.   We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy. et.al.|[2402.08644](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644)|null|

It holds significant implications across various NLP tasks, including offering insights into the capabilities and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness.

These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources. Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences. The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework.

Current research primarily focuses on white-box LLMs editing, overlooking an important scenario: black-box LLMs editing, where LLMs are accessed through interfaces and only textual output is available. To address the limitations of existing evaluations that are not inapplicable to black-box LLM editing and lack comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective evaluation framework, incorporating the assessment of style retention for the first time. To tackle privacy leaks of editing data and style over-editing in current methods, we introduce a novel postEdit framework, resolving privacy concerns through downstream post-processing and maintaining textual style consistency via fine-grained editing to original responses. Experiments and analysis on two benchmarks demonstrate that postEdit outperforms all baselines and achieves strong generalization, especially with huge improvements on style retention (average $+20.82\%\uparrow$ ). et.al.|[2402.08631](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08631)|null|

In this work, we present AnyDoor, a test-time backdoor attack against multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which involves injecting the backdoor into the textual modality using adversarial test images (sharing the same universal perturbation), without requiring access to or modification of the training data. AnyDoor employs similar techniques used in universal adversarial attacks, but distinguishes itself by its ability to decouple the timing of setup and activation of harmful effects. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of AnyDoor against popular MLLMs such as LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and BLIP-2, as well as provide comprehensive ablation studies. Notably, because the backdoor is injected by a universal perturbation, AnyDoor can dynamically change its backdoor trigger prompts/harmful effects, exposing a new challenge for defending against backdoor attacks.

Nonetheless, red-teaming efforts have revealed that adversarial images/prompts can jailbreak an MLLM and cause unaligned behaviors. In this work, we report an even more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors. To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak, we simulate multi-agent environments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, and employ randomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agent interaction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial image into the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieve infectious jailbreak. Finally, we derive a simple principle for determining whether a defense mechanism can provably restrain the spread of infectious jailbreak, but how to design a practical defense that meets this principle remains an open question to investigate.

For decision-makers and policymakers focused on wildfire resilience and adaptation, it is crucial to obtain responses that are not only precise but also domain-specific, rather than generic. To that end, we developed WildfireGPT, a prototype LLM agent designed to transform user queries into actionable insights on wildfire risks. We enrich WildfireGPT by providing additional context such as climate projections and scientific literature to ensure its information is current, relevant, and scientifically accurate. This enables WildfireGPT to be an effective tool for delivering detailed, user-specific insights on wildfire risks to support a diverse set of end users, including researchers, engineers, urban planners, emergency managers, and infrastructure operators. et.al.|[2402.07877](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07877)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Policy Improvement using Language Feedback Models**|We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning. et.al.|[2402.07876](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07876)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Scaling Laws for Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts**|Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a primary solution for reducing the computational cost of Large Language Models. In this work, we analyze their scaling properties, incorporating an expanded range of variables. Specifically, we introduce a new hyperparameter, granularity, whose adjustment enables precise control over the size of the experts. Building on this, we establish scaling laws for fine-grained MoE, taking into account the number of training tokens, model size, and granularity. Leveraging these laws, we derive the optimal training configuration for a given computational budget. Our findings not only show that MoE models consistently outperform dense Transformers but also highlight that the efficiency gap between dense and MoE models widens as we scale up the model size and training budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the common practice of setting the size of experts in MoE to mirror the feed-forward layer is not optimal at almost any computational budget. et.al.|[2402.07871](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07871)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**PoisonedRAG: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate those limitations. In particular, given a question, RAG retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge database to augment the input of the LLM. For instance, the retrieved knowledge could be a set of top-k texts that are most semantically similar to the given question when the knowledge database contains millions of texts collected from Wikipedia. As a result, the LLM could utilize the retrieved knowledge as the context to generate an answer for the given question. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we propose PoisonedRAG , a set of knowledge poisoning attacks to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few poisoned texts into the knowledge database such that the LLM generates an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of poisoned texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on the RAG, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show our attacks could achieve 90% attack success rates when injecting 5 poisoned texts for each target question into a database with millions of texts. We also evaluate recent defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for new defenses. et.al.|[2402.07867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867)|**[link](https://github.com/sleeepeer/poisonedrag)**|
|**2024-02-12**|**AI-Augmented Predictions: LLM Assistants Improve Human Forecasting Accuracy**|Large language models (LLMs) show impressive capabilities, matching and sometimes exceeding human performance in many domains. This study explores the potential of LLMs to augment judgement in forecasting tasks. We evaluated the impact on forecasting accuracy of two GPT-4-Turbo assistants: one designed to provide high-quality advice ('superforecasting'), and the other designed to be overconfident and base-rate-neglecting. Participants (N = 991) had the option to consult their assigned LLM assistant throughout the study, in contrast to a control group that used a less advanced model (DaVinci-003) without direct forecasting support. Our preregistered analyses reveal that LLM augmentation significantly enhances forecasting accuracy by 23% across both types of assistants, compared to the control group. This improvement occurs despite the superforecasting assistant's higher accuracy in predictions, indicating the augmentation's benefit is not solely due to model prediction accuracy. Exploratory analyses showed a pronounced effect in one forecasting item, without which we find that the superforecasting assistant increased accuracy by 43%, compared with 28% for the biased assistant. We further examine whether LLM augmentation disproportionately benefits less skilled forecasters, degrades the wisdom-of-the-crowd by reducing prediction diversity, or varies in effectiveness with question difficulty. Our findings do not consistently support these hypotheses. Our results suggest that access to an LLM assistant, even a biased one, can be a helpful decision aid in cognitively demanding tasks where the answer is not known at the time of interaction. et.al.|[2402.07862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07862)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Mercury: An Efficiency Benchmark for LLM Code Synthesis**|Despite advancements in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis, benchmarks have predominantly focused on functional correctness, overlooking the importance of code efficiency. We present Mercury, the first benchmark designated for assessing the code efficiency of LLM code synthesis tasks. Mercury consists of 1,889 programming tasks covering diverse difficulty levels alongside test case generators generating unlimited cases for comprehensive evaluation. Unlike existing benchmarks, Mercury integrates a novel metric Beyond@K to measure normalized code efficiency based on historical submissions, leading to a new evaluation indicator for code synthesis, which encourages generating functionally correct and computationally efficient code, mirroring the real-world software development standard. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate the remarkable capability to generate functionally correct code, there still exists a substantial gap in their efficiency output, underscoring a new frontier for LLM research and development. et.al.|[2402.07844](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07844)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Do Membership Inference Attacks Work on Large Language Models?**|Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model's training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs). We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Our further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We identify specific settings where LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference and show that the apparent success in such settings can be attributed to a distribution shift, such as when members and non-members are drawn from the seemingly identical domain but with different temporal ranges. We release our code and data as a unified benchmark package that includes all existing MIAs, supporting future work. et.al.|[2402.07841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07841)|null|

What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first-class citizen languages? Our work introduces Aya, a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 50% are considered as lower-resourced. Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages. We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state-of-art for multilingual eval across 99 languages -- including discriminative and generative tasks, human evaluation, and simulated win rates that cover both held-out tasks and in-distribution performance. Furthermore, we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition, data pruning, as well as the toxicity, bias, and safety of our models. We open-source our instruction datasets and our model at https://hf.co/CohereForAI/aya-101 et.al.|[2402.07827](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning**|Finetuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs finetuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) finetuning of pretrained LLMs has garnered increasing attention to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM finetuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff between privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based finetuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD. In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on finetuning trajectory. Second, we further enhance the scalability by reducing the trainable parameters that are identified by repurposing a data-free pruning technique requiring no additional data or extra privacy budget. We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility. et.al.|[2402.07818](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818)|null|
|**2024-02-12**|**Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process as Sequential Decision Making**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong ability to assist people and show "sparks of intelligence". However, several open challenges hinder their wider application: such as concerns over privacy, tendencies to produce hallucinations, and difficulties in handling long contexts. In this work, we address those challenges by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimize such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search, and learns a Q-value estimator that permits cost-efficient inference. In addressing the task of question-answering with private data, where ethical and security concerns limit LLM training methods, RATP achieves a 50% improvement over existing in-context retrieval-augmented language models. et.al.|[2402.07812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07812)|null|

Yet, the reliability and truthfulness of these models remain pressing concerns. To this end, we investigate iterative prompting, a strategy hypothesized to refine LLM responses, assessing its impact on LLM truthfulness, an area which has not been thoroughly explored. Our extensive experiments delve into the intricacies of iterative prompting variants, examining their influence on the accuracy and calibration of model responses. Our findings reveal that naive prompting methods significantly undermine truthfulness, leading to exacerbated calibration errors. In response to these challenges, we introduce several prompting variants designed to address the identified issues. These variants demonstrate marked improvements over existing baselines, signaling a promising direction for future research. Our work provides a nuanced understanding of iterative prompting and introduces novel approaches to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. et.al.|[2402.06625](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06625)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction Tuning**|Datasets are foundational to many breakthroughs in modern artificial intelligence. Many recent achievements in the space of natural language processing (NLP) can be attributed to the finetuning of pre-trained models on a diverse set of tasks that enables a large language model (LLM) to respond to instructions. Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) requires specifically constructed and annotated datasets. However, existing datasets are almost all in the English language. In this work, our primary goal is to bridge the language gap by building a human-curated instruction-following dataset spanning 65 languages. We worked with fluent speakers of languages from around the world to collect natural instances of instructions and completions. Furthermore, we create the most extensive multilingual collection to date, comprising 513 million instances through templating and translating existing datasets across 114 languages. In total, we contribute four key resources: we develop and open-source the Aya Annotation Platform, the Aya Dataset, the Aya Collection, and the Aya Evaluation Suite. The Aya initiative also serves as a valuable case study in participatory research, involving collaborators from 119 countries.

|**2024-02-09**|**On the Out-Of-Distribution Generalization of Multimodal Large Language Models**|We investigate the generalization boundaries of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via comprehensive evaluation under out-of-distribution scenarios and domain-specific tasks. We evaluate their zero-shot generalization across synthetic images, real-world distributional shifts, and specialized datasets like medical and molecular imagery. Empirical results indicate that MLLMs struggle with generalization beyond common training domains, limiting their direct application without adaptation. To understand the cause of unreliable performance, we analyze three hypotheses: semantic misinterpretation, visual feature extraction insufficiency, and mapping deficiency. Results identify mapping deficiency as the primary hurdle. To address this problem, we show that in-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance MLLMs' generalization, opening new avenues for overcoming generalization barriers. We further explore the robustness of ICL under distribution shifts and show its vulnerability to domain shifts, label shifts, and spurious correlation shifts between in-context examples and test data. et.al.|[2402.06599](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06599)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**CigaR: Cost-efficient Program Repair with LLMs**|Large language models (LLM) have proven to be effective at automated program repair (APR). However, using LLMs can be highly costly, with companies invoicing users by the number of tokens. In this paper, we propose CigaR, the first LLM-based APR tool that focuses on minimizing the repair cost. CigaR works in two major steps: generating a plausible patch and multiplying plausible patches. CigaR optimizes the prompts and the prompt setting to maximize the information given to LLMs in the smallest possible number of tokens. Our experiments on 267 bugs from the widely used Defects4J dataset shows that CigaR reduces the token cost by 62. On average, CigaR spends 171k tokens per bug while the baseline uses 451k tokens. On the subset of bugs that are fixed by both, CigaR spends 20k per bug while the baseline uses 695k tokens, a cost saving of 97. Our extensive experiments show that CigaR is a cost-effective LLM-based program repair tool that uses a low number of tokens to generate automatic patches. et.al.|[2402.06598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06598)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**Understanding the Weakness of Large Language Model Agents within a Complex Android Environment**|Large language models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent agents to execute intricate tasks within domain-specific software such as browsers and games. However, when applied to general-purpose software systems like operating systems, LLM agents face three primary challenges. Firstly, the action space is vast and dynamic, posing difficulties for LLM agents to maintain an up-to-date understanding and deliver accurate responses. Secondly, real-world tasks often require inter-application cooperation}, demanding farsighted planning from LLM agents. Thirdly, agents need to identify optimal solutions aligning with user constraints, such as security concerns and preferences. These challenges motivate AndroidArena, an environment and benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on a modern operating system. To address high-cost of manpower, we design a scalable and semi-automated method to construct the benchmark. In the task evaluation, AndroidArena incorporates accurate and adaptive metrics to address the issue of non-unique solutions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLM agents struggle in cross-APP scenarios and adhering to specific constraints. Additionally, we identify a lack of four key capabilities, i.e., understanding, reasoning, exploration, and reflection, as primary reasons for the failure of LLM agents. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on the failure of reflection, and improve the success rate by 27% with our proposed exploration strategy. This work is the first to present valuable insights in understanding fine-grained weakness of LLM agents, and offers a path forward for future research in this area.

Automatically scoring written responses to science questions in German is a complex task and challenging for standard G-BERT as they lack contextual knowledge in the science domain and may be unaligned with student writing styles. This paper developed a contextualized German Science Education BERT (G-SciEdBERT), an innovative large language model tailored for scoring German-written responses to science tasks. Using G-BERT, we pre-trained G-SciEdBERT on a corpus of 50K German written science responses with 5M tokens to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. We fine-tuned G-SciEdBERT on 59 assessment items and examined the scoring accuracy. We then compared its performance with G-BERT. Our findings reveal a substantial improvement in scoring accuracy with G-SciEdBERT, demonstrating a 10% increase of quadratic weighted kappa compared to G-BERT (mean accuracy difference = 0.096, SD = 0.024). These insights underline the significance of specialized language models like G-SciEdBERT, which is trained to enhance the accuracy of automated scoring, offering a substantial contribution to the field of AI in education. et.al.|[2402.06584](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06584)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**The Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network: Theory and Experiments with a Logical Graphical Model**|This paper introduces the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), which provides a unified view of logical and probabilistic reasoning. The QBBN is meant to address a central problem with the Large Language Model (LLM), which has become extremely popular in Information Retrieval, which is that the LLM hallucinates. A Bayesian Network, by construction, cannot hallucinate, because it can only return answers that it can explain. We show how a Bayesian Network over an unbounded number of boolean variables can be configured to represent the logical reasoning underlying human language. We do this by creating a key-value version of the First-Order Calculus, for which we can prove consistency and completeness. We show that the model is trivially trained over fully observed data, but that inference is non-trivial. Exact inference in a Bayesian Network is intractable (i.e. $\Omega(2^N)$ for $N$ variables). For inference, we investigate the use of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which is not guaranteed to converge, but which has been shown to often converge in practice. Our experiments show that LBP indeed does converge very reliably, and our analysis shows that a round of LBP takes time $O(N2^n)$, where $N$ bounds the number of variables considered, and $n$ bounds the number of incoming connections to any factor, and further improvements may be possible. Our network is specifically designed to alternate between AND and OR gates in a Boolean Algebra, which connects more closely to logical reasoning, allowing a completeness proof for an expanded version of our network, and also allows inference to follow specific but adequate pathways, that turn out to be fast. et.al.|[2402.06557](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06557)|null|

|**2024-02-09**|**Calibrating Long-form Generations from Large Language Models**|To enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability, calibration is essential -- the model's assessed confidence scores should align with the actual likelihood of its responses being correct. However, current confidence elicitation methods and calibration metrics typically rely on a binary true/false assessment of response correctness. This approach does not apply to long-form generation, where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this gap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the correctness of the LLMs' responses and their associated confidence levels are treated as distributions across a range of scores. Within this framework, we develop three metrics to precisely evaluate LLM calibration and further propose two confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and self-evaluation. Our experiments, which include long-form QA and summarization tasks, demonstrate that larger models don't necessarily guarantee better calibration, that calibration performance is found to be metric-dependent, and that self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that calibration can be enhanced through techniques such as fine-tuning, integrating relevant source documents, scaling the temperature, and combining self-consistency with self-evaluation. Lastly, we showcase a practical application of our system: selecting and cascading open-source models and ChatGPT to optimize correctness given a limited API budget. This research not only challenges existing notions of LLM calibration but also offers practical methodologies for improving trustworthiness in long-form generation. et.al.|[2402.06544](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06544)|null|
|**2024-02-09**|**Introspective Planning: Guiding Language-Enabled Agents to Refine Their Own Uncertainty**|Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning skills, enabling robots to comprehend natural language instructions and strategically plan high-level actions through proper grounding. However, LLM hallucination may result in robots confidently executing plans that are misaligned with user goals or, in extreme cases, unsafe. Additionally, inherent ambiguity in natural language instructions can induce task uncertainty, particularly in situations where multiple valid options exist. To address this issue, LLMs must identify such uncertainty and proactively seek clarification. This paper explores the concept of introspective planning as a systematic method for guiding LLMs in forming uncertainty--aware plans for robotic task execution without the need for fine-tuning. We investigate uncertainty quantification in task-level robot planning and demonstrate that introspection significantly improves both success rates and safety compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planning approaches. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of introspective planning in conjunction with conformal prediction, revealing that this combination yields tighter confidence bounds, thereby maintaining statistical success guarantees with fewer superfluous user clarification queries. et.al.|[2402.06529](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06529)|null|

LLaDA achieves this by leveraging the impressive zero-shot generalizability of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting the traffic rules in the local driver handbook.

To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models that can generalize to novel settings.

However, the intensive memory requirements for fine-tuning LLMs pose significant challenges, especially when deploying on edge devices with limited computational resources. To circumvent this, we explore the novel integration of Memory-efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization within a federated setting, a synergy we denote as FedMeZO. Our study is the first to examine the theoretical underpinnings of FedMeZO in the context of LLMs, tackling key questions regarding the influence of large parameter spaces on optimization behavior, the establishment of convergence properties, and the identification of critical parameters for convergence to inform personalized federated strategies. Our extensive empirical evidence supports the theory, showing that FedMeZO not only converges faster than traditional first-order methods such as SGD but also significantly reduces GPU memory usage during training to levels comparable to those during inference. Moreover, the proposed personalized FL strategy that is built upon the theoretical insights to customize the client-wise learning rate can effectively accelerate loss reduction. We hope our work can help to bridge theoretical and practical aspects of federated fine-tuning for LLMs and facilitate further development and research. et.al.|[2402.05926](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05926)|null|
|**2024-02-08**|**Efficient Stagewise Pretraining via Progressive Subnetworks**|Recent developments in large language models have sparked interest in efficient pretraining methods. A recent effective paradigm is to perform stage-wise training, where the size of the model is gradually increased over the course of training (e.g. gradual stacking (Reddi et al., 2023)). While the resource and wall-time savings are appealing, it has limitations, particularly the inability to evaluate the full model during earlier stages, and degradation in model quality due to smaller model capacity in the initial stages. In this work, we propose an alternative framework, progressive subnetwork training, that maintains the full model throughout training, but only trains subnetworks within the model in each step. We focus on a simple instantiation of this framework, Random Path Training (RaPTr) that only trains a sub-path of layers in each step, progressively increasing the path lengths in stages. RaPTr achieves better pre-training loss for BERT and UL2 language models while requiring 20-33% fewer FLOPs compared to standard training, and is competitive or better than other efficient training methods. Furthermore, RaPTr shows better downstream performance on UL2, improving QA tasks and SuperGLUE by 1-5% compared to standard training and stacking. Finally, we provide a theoretical basis for RaPTr to justify (a) the increasing complexity of subnetworks in stages, and (b) the stability in loss across stage transitions due to residual connections and layer norm. et.al.|[2402.05913](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05913)|null|

To address the societal challenge, we introduce FACT-GPT, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the claim matching stage of fact-checking. FACT-GPT, trained on a synthetic dataset, identifies social media content that aligns with, contradicts, or is irrelevant to previously debunked claims. Our evaluation shows that our specialized LLMs can match the accuracy of larger models in identifying related claims, closely mirroring human judgment.

|**2024-02-08**|**Large Language Model Meets Graph Neural Network in Knowledge Distillation**|Despite recent community revelations about the advancements and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding Text-Attributed Graphs (TAG), the deployment of LLMs for production is hindered by their high computational and storage requirements, as well as long latencies during inference. Simultaneously, although traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are light weight and adept at learning structural features of graphs, their ability to grasp the complex semantics in TAGs is somewhat constrained for real applications. To address these limitations, we concentrate on the downstream task of node classification in TAG and propose a novel graph knowledge distillation framework, termed Linguistic Graph Knowledge Distillation (LinguGKD), using LLMs as teacher models and GNNs as student models for knowledge distillation. It involves TAG-oriented instruction tuning of LLM on designed node classification prompts, followed by aligning the hierarchically learned node features of the teacher LLM and the student GNN in latent space, employing a layer-adaptive contrastive learning strategy. Through extensive experiments on a variety of LLM and GNN models and multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed LinguGKD significantly boosts the student GNN's predictive accuracy and convergence rate, without the need of extra data or model parameters. Compared to teacher LLM, distilled GNN achieves superior inference speed equipped with much fewer computing and storage demands, when surpassing the teacher LLM's classification performance on some of benchmark datasets. et.al.|[2402.05894](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05894)|null|
|**2024-02-08**|**Generative Echo Chamber? Effects of LLM-Powered Search Systems on Diverse Information Seeking**|Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers -- limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated LLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias. These results present critical implications for the development of LLMs and conversational search systems, and the policy governing these technologies. et.al.|[2402.05880](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05880)|null|
|**2024-02-08**|**PromptCrypt: Prompt Encryption for Secure Communication with Large Language Models**|Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications. While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy. It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected. We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis. Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption. These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt. et.al.|[2402.05868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05868)|**[link](https://github.com/agiresearch/promptcrypt)**|
|**2024-02-08**|**How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis**|Negotiation is the basis of social interactions; humans negotiate everything from the price of cars to how to share common resources. With rapidly growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible dialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations. Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20\% when negotiating against the standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, \NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions, enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning abilities. et.al.|[2402.05863](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05863)|**[link](https://github.com/vinid/negotiationarena)**|
|**2024-02-07**|**Opening the AI black box: program synthesis via mechanistic interpretability**|We present MIPS, a novel method for program synthesis based on automated mechanistic interpretability of neural networks trained to perform the desired task, auto-distilling the learned algorithm into Python code. We test MIPS on a benchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it highly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are not solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to convert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer symbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large language models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is therefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from GitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to make machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy. et.al.|[2402.05110](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05110)|null|
|**2024-02-07**|**You Can REST Now: Automated Specification Inference and Black-Box Testing of RESTful APIs with Large Language Models**|RESTful APIs are popular web services, requiring documentation to ease their comprehension, reusability and testing practices. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a widely adopted and machine-readable format used to document such APIs. However, manually documenting RESTful APIs is a time-consuming and error-prone task, resulting in unavailable, incomplete, or imprecise documentation. As RESTful API testing tools require an OpenAPI specification as input, insufficient or informal documentation hampers testing quality.   Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities to automate tasks based on their colossal training data. Accordingly, such capabilities could be utilized to assist the documentation and testing process of RESTful APIs.   In this paper, we present RESTSpecIT, the first automated RESTful API specification inference and black-box testing approach leveraging LLMs. The approach requires minimal user input compared to state-of-the-art RESTful API inference and testing tools; Given an API name and an LLM key, HTTP requests are generated and mutated with data returned by the LLM. By sending the requests to the API endpoint, HTTP responses can be analyzed for inference and testing purposes. RESTSpecIT utilizes an in-context prompt masking strategy, requiring no model fine-tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that RESTSpecIT is capable of: (1) inferring specifications with 85.05% of GET routes and 81.05% of query parameters found on average, (2) discovering undocumented and valid routes and parameters, and (3) uncovering server errors in RESTful APIs. Inferred specifications can also be used as testing tool inputs. et.al.|[2402.05102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05102)|null|
|**2024-02-07**|**Hydragen: High-Throughput LLM Inference with Shared Prefixes**|Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are now deployed to hundreds of millions of users. LLM inference is commonly performed on batches of sequences that share a prefix, such as few-shot examples or a chatbot system prompt. Decoding in this large-batch setting can be bottlenecked by the attention operation, which reads large key-value (KV) caches from memory and computes inefficient matrix-vector products for every sequence in the batch. In this work, we introduce Hydragen, a hardware-aware exact implementation of attention with shared prefixes. Hydragen computes attention over the shared prefix and unique suffixes separately. This decomposition enables efficient prefix attention by batching queries together across sequences, reducing redundant memory reads and enabling the use of hardware-friendly matrix multiplications. Our method can improve end-to-end LLM throughput by up to 32x against competitive baselines, with speedup growing with the batch size and shared prefix length. Hydragen also enables the use of very long shared contexts: with a high batch size, increasing the prefix length from 1K to 16K tokens decreases Hydragen throughput by less than 15%, while the throughput of baselines drops by over 90%. Hydragen generalizes beyond simple prefix-suffix decomposition and can be applied to tree-based prompt sharing patterns, allowing us to further reduce inference time on competitive programming problems by 55%. et.al.|[2402.05099](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05099)|null|

To meet this crucial need, we propose \emph{SALAD-Bench}, a safety benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs, attack, and defense methods. Distinguished by its breadth, SALAD-Bench transcends conventional benchmarks through its large scale, rich diversity, intricate taxonomy spanning three levels, and versatile functionalities.SALAD-Bench is crafted with a meticulous array of questions, from standard queries to complex ones enriched with attack, defense modifications and multiple-choice.

|**2024-02-07**|**A Sober Look at LLMs for Material Discovery: Are They Actually Good for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules?**|Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space. While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs). However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches. Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate -- an integral part of BO -- from point-estimated, non-Bayesian LLMs. In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled Bayesian optimization in the molecular space. We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question. This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate. Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data. et.al.|[2402.05015](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05015)|**[link](https://github.com/wiseodd/lapeft-bayesopt)**|
|**2024-02-07**|**Pedagogical Alignment of Large Language Models**|In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of pedagogically aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) that signifies a transformative shift in the application of LLMs within educational contexts. Rather than providing direct responses to user queries, pedagogically-aligned LLMs function as scaffolding tools, breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems and guiding students towards the final answer through constructive feedback and hints. The objective is to equip learners with problem-solving strategies that deepen their understanding and internalization of the subject matter. Previous research in this field has primarily applied the supervised finetuning approach without framing the objective as an alignment problem, hence not employing reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) methods. This study reinterprets the narrative by viewing the task through the lens of alignment and demonstrates how RLHF methods emerge naturally as a superior alternative for aligning LLM behaviour. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel approach for constructing a reward dataset specifically designed for the pedagogical alignment of LLMs. We apply three state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms and find that they outperform SFT significantly. Our qualitative analyses across model differences and hyperparameter sensitivity further validate the superiority of RLHF over SFT. Also, our study sheds light on the potential of online feedback for enhancing the performance of pedagogically-aligned LLMs, thus providing valuable insights for the advancement of these models in educational settings. et.al.|[2402.05000](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05000)|null|
|**2024-02-07**|**An Enhanced Prompt-Based LLM Reasoning Scheme via Knowledge Graph-Integrated Collaboration**|While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in a multitude of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they encounter challenges in practical applications, including issues with hallucinations, inadequate knowledge updating, and limited transparency in the reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues. et.al.|[2402.04978](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04978)|null|

Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children's autonomous Scratch learning: artist's block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist's block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance.

|**2024-02-07**|**Reconfidencing LLMs from the Grouping Loss Perspective**|Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and LLaMA, are susceptible to generating hallucinated answers in a confident tone. While efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have proven useful, recent findings show that controlling uncertainty must go beyond calibration: predicted scores may deviate significantly from the actual posterior probabilities due to the impact of grouping loss. In this work, we construct a new evaluation dataset derived from a knowledge base to assess confidence scores given to answers of Mistral and LLaMA. Experiments show that they tend to be overconfident. Further, we show that they are more overconfident on some answers than others, \emph{eg} depending on the nationality of the person in the query. In uncertainty-quantification theory, this is grouping loss. To address this, we propose a solution to reconfidence LLMs, canceling not only calibration but also grouping loss. The LLMs, after the reconfidencing process, indicate improved confidence alignment with the accuracy of their responses. et.al.|[2402.04957](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04957)|null|

Traditionally, cognitive assistants respond in specific ways to predefined user intents and conversation patterns. However, this rigidness does not handle the diversity of natural language well. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), powering large language models (LLM) such as GPT-4, Llama2, and Gemini, could enable CAs to converse in a more flexible, human-like manner. However, the additional degrees of freedom may have unforeseen consequences, especially in knowledge-intensive contexts where accuracy is crucial. As a preliminary step to assessing the potential of using LLMs in these contexts, we conducted a user study comparing an LLM-based CA to an intent-based system regarding interaction efficiency, user experience, workload, and usability. This revealed that LLM-based CAs exhibited better user experience, task completion rate, usability, and perceived performance than intent-based systems, suggesting that switching NLP techniques should be investigated further. et.al.|[2402.04955](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04955)|null|

We utilize over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable. AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a GPT-4 variant tailored for tool utilization. For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.4% in terms of average pass rate on ToolBench.

While their capabilities are promising, they also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This position paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively. et.al.|[2402.04247](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04247)|null|
|**2024-02-06**|**Can Generative Agents Predict Emotion?**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a number of human-like abilities, however the empathic understanding and emotional state of LLMs is yet to be aligned to that of humans. In this work, we investigate how the emotional state of generative LLM agents evolves as they perceive new events, introducing a novel architecture in which new experiences are compared to past memories. Through this comparison, the agent gains the ability to understand new experiences in context, which according to the appraisal theory of emotion is vital in emotion creation. First, the agent perceives new experiences as time series text data. After perceiving each new input, the agent generates a summary of past relevant memories, referred to as the norm, and compares the new experience to this norm. Through this comparison we can analyse how the agent reacts to the new experience in context. The PANAS, a test of affect, is administered to the agent, capturing the emotional state of the agent after the perception of the new event. Finally, the new experience is then added to the agents memory to be used in the creation of future norms. By creating multiple experiences in natural language from emotionally charged situations, we test the proposed architecture on a wide range of scenarios. The mixed results suggests that introducing context can occasionally improve the emotional alignment of the agent, but further study and comparison with human evaluators is necessary. We hope that this paper is another step towards the alignment of generative agents. et.al.|[2402.04232](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04232)|null|

|**2024-02-06**|**SHIELD : An Evaluation Benchmark for Face Spoofing and Forgery Detection with Multimodal Large Language Models**|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities in various vision fields (e.g., generic object recognition and grounding) based on strong visual semantic representation and language reasoning ability. However, whether MLLMs are sensitive to subtle visual spoof/forged clues and how they perform in the domain of face attack detection (e.g., face spoofing and forgery detection) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, namely SHIELD, to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal face data in these two face security tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three different modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, depth) under four types of presentation attacks (i.e., print attack, replay attack, rigid mask, paper mask). For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data with both visual and acoustic modalities. Each question is subjected to both zero-shot and few-shot tests under standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. The results indicate that MLLMs hold substantial potential in the face security domain, offering advantages over traditional specific models in terms of interpretability, multimodal flexible reasoning, and joint face spoof and forgery detection. Additionally, we develop a novel Multi-Attribute Chain of Thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images, which provides rich task-related knowledge for subtle spoof/forged clue mining. Extensive experiments in separate face anti-spoofing, separate face forgery detection, and joint detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-COT.

|**2024-02-06**|**Scaling Laws for Downstream Task Performance of Large Language Models**|Scaling laws provide important insights that can guide the design of large language models (LLMs). Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by two metrics: downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream BLEU score with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are also cases where moderate misalignment causes the BLEU score to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these observations, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data. et.al.|[2402.04177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04177)|null|

In this paper, we present how we scaled the product from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions. This evolution required us to overcome several unique challenges in improving the usability of these suggestions for developers.   First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users. These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions. Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%. Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. et.al.|[2402.04141](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04141)|null|

|**2024-02-06**|**Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology: LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases. Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks. et.al.|[2402.04105](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04105)|null|
|**2024-02-05**|**Nevermind: Instruction Override and Moderation in Large Language Models**|Given the impressive capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate and benchmark the most popular proprietary and different sized open source models on the task of explicit instruction following in conflicting situations, e.g. overrides. These include the ability of the model to override the knowledge within the weights of the model, the ability to override (or moderate) extracted knowledge in the prompt, and lastly the ability to perform a full jailbreak. Experimentation performed suggest several key findings to improve instruction following - larger models perform the best in following instructions that override internal and contextual instructions, and are obedient, even to a fault. When scaling to longer contexts via rope scaling, a significant buffer needs to be maintained from the edge of the perplexity cliff in order to maintain instruction following capabilities. Finally, we observe improving instruction following, and subsequently instruction overrides/jailbreaks, is fundamentally at odds with the ability of a language model to follow given safety filters or guidelines. Thus, we postulate the most effective approach for safe, trustworthy AI should be dealt external to the LLM itself. et.al.|[2402.03303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03303)|null|
|**2024-02-05**|**GUARD: Role-playing to Generate Natural-language Jailbreakings to Test Guideline Adherence of Large Language Models**|The discovery of "jailbreaks" to bypass safety filters of Large Language Models (LLMs) and harmful responses have encouraged the community to implement safety measures. One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities. et.al.|[2402.03299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03299)|null|

This is due to the lack of PPA awareness in conventional transformer decoding algorithms. In response, we present an automated transformer decoding algorithm that integrates Monte Carlo tree-search for lookahead, guiding the transformer to produce compilable, functionally correct, and PPA-optimized code. Empirical evaluation with a fine-tuned language model on RTL codesets shows that our proposed technique consistently generates functionally correct code compared to prompting-only methods and effectively addresses the PPA-unawareness drawback of naive large language models. For the largest design generated by the state-of-the-art LLM (16-bit adder), our technique can achieve a 31.8% improvement in the area-delay product. et.al.|[2402.03289](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03289)|null|

Forecasting Uncertainty in Conversations using Large Language Models**|Effective interlocutors account for the uncertain goals, beliefs, and emotions of others. But even the best human conversationalist cannot perfectly anticipate the trajectory of a dialogue. How well can language models represent inherent uncertainty in conversations? We propose FortUne Dial, an expansion of the long-standing "conversation forecasting" task: instead of just accuracy, evaluation is conducted with uncertainty-aware metrics, effectively enabling abstention on individual instances. We study two ways in which language models potentially represent outcome uncertainty (internally, using scores and directly, using tokens) and propose fine-tuning strategies to improve calibration of both representations. Experiments on eight difficult negotiation corpora demonstrate that our proposed fine-tuning strategies (a traditional supervision strategy and an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy) can calibrate smaller open-source models to compete with pre-trained models 10x their size. et.al.|[2402.03284](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03284)|null|
|**2024-02-05**|**Uncertainty of Thoughts: Uncertainty-Aware Planning Enhances Information Seeking in Large Language Models**|In the face of uncertainty, the ability to seek information is of fundamental importance. In many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, the information needed to solve the task is not initially given, and has to be actively sought by asking follow-up questions (for example, a doctor asking a patient for more details about their symptoms). In this work, we introduce Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to augment large language models with the ability to actively seek information by asking effective questions. UoT combines 1) an uncertainty-aware simulation approach which enables the model to simulate possible future scenarios and how likely they are to occur, 2) uncertainty-based rewards motivated by information gain which incentivizes the model to seek information, and 3) a reward propagation scheme to select the optimal question to ask in a way that maximizes the expected reward. In experiments on medical diagnosis, troubleshooting and the '20 Questions' game, UoT achieves an average performance improvement of 57.8% in the rate of successful task completion across multiple LLMs compared with direct prompting, and also improves efficiency (i.e., the number of questions needed to complete the task). et.al.|[2402.03271](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03271)|**[link](https://github.com/zhiyuanhubj/uot)**|

However, leveraging environment reward signals for continual LLM actor improvement is not straightforward. We propose Skill Set Optimization (SSO) for improving LLM actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. SSO constructs skills by extracting common subtrajectories with high rewards and generating subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided to the LLM actor in-context to reinforce behaviors with high rewards. Then, SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards. We evaluate our method in the classic videogame NetHack and the text environment ScienceWorld to demonstrate SSO's ability to optimize a set of skills and perform in-context policy improvement. SSO outperforms baselines by 40% in our custom NetHack task and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in ScienceWorld by 35%. et.al.|[2402.03244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03244)|null|

However, previous synthetic datasets have limitations, such as featuring only one skill per sentence and generally comprising short sentences. In this paper, we introduce JobSkape, a framework to generate synthetic data that tackles these limitations, specifically designed to enhance skill-to-taxonomy matching. Within this framework, we create SkillSkape, a comprehensive open-source synthetic dataset of job postings tailored for skill-matching tasks. We introduce several offline metrics that show that our dataset resembles real-world data. Additionally, we present a multi-step pipeline for skill extraction and matching tasks using large language models (LLMs), benchmarking against known supervised methodologies.

|**2024-02-05**|**English Prompts are Better for NLI-based Zero-Shot Emotion Classification than Target-Language Prompts**|Emotion classification in text is a challenging and subjective task, due to the involved cognitive inference processes that are required to interpret a textual stimulus. In addition, the set of emotion categories is highly domain-specific. For instance, literature analysis might require the use of aesthetic emotions (e.g., finding something beautiful), and social media analysis could benefit from fine-grained sets (e.g., separating anger from annoyance) in contrast to basic emotion categories. This renders the task an interesting field for zero-shot classifications, in which the label set is not known at model development time. Unfortunately, most resources for emotion analysis are English, and therefore, most studies on emotion analysis have been performed in English, including those that involve prompting language models for text labels. This leaves us with a research gap that we address in this paper: In which language should we prompt for emotion labels on non-English texts? This is particularly of interest when we have access to a multilingual large language model, because we could request labels with English prompts even for non-English data. Our experiments with natural language inference-based language models show that it is consistently better to use English prompts even if the data is in a different language. et.al.|[2402.03223](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03223)|null|
|**2024-02-05**|**Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models**|Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations. et.al.|[2402.03190](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03190)|**[link](https://github.com/openkg-org/easydetect)**|
|**2024-02-05**|**Empowering Time Series Analysis with Large Language Models: A Survey**|Recently, remarkable progress has been made over large language models (LLMs), demonstrating their unprecedented capability in varieties of natural language tasks. However, completely training a large general-purpose model from the scratch is challenging for time series analysis, due to the large volumes and varieties of time series data, as well as the non-stationarity that leads to concept drift impeding continuous model adaptation and re-training. Recent advances have shown that pre-trained LLMs can be exploited to capture complex dependencies in time series data and facilitate various applications. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LLMs for time series analysis. Specifically, we first state the challenges and motivations of applying language models in the context of time series as well as brief preliminaries of LLMs. Next, we summarize the general pipeline for LLM-based time series analysis, categorize existing methods into different groups (i.e., direct query, tokenization, prompt design, fine-tune, and model integration), and highlight the key ideas within each group. We also discuss the applications of LLMs for both general and spatial-temporal time series data, tailored to specific domains. Finally, we thoroughly discuss future research opportunities to empower time series analysis with LLMs. et.al.|[2402.03182](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03182)|null|
|**2024-02-02**|**TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents**|Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents? To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans. Comprehensive evaluations show that the current language agents are not yet capable of handling such complex planning tasks-even GPT-4 only achieves a success rate of 0.6%. Language agents struggle to stay on task, use the right tools to collect information, or keep track of multiple constraints. However, we note that the mere possibility for language agents to tackle such a complex problem is in itself non-trivial progress. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language agents. et.al.|[2402.01622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01622)|null|
|**2024-02-02**|**Stochastic Two Points Method for Deep Model Zeroth-order Optimization**|Large foundation models, such as large language models, have performed exceptionally well in various application scenarios. Building or fully fine-tuning such large models is usually prohibitive due to either hardware budget or lack of access to backpropagation. The zeroth-order methods offer a promising direction for tackling this challenge, where only forward passes are needed to update the model. This paper introduces an efficient Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) approach within the gradient-free regime. We present the theoretical convergence properties of S2P under the general and relaxed smoothness assumptions. The theoretical properties also shed light on a faster and more stable S2P variant, Accelerated S2P (AS2P), through exploiting our new convergence properties that better represent the dynamics of deep models in training. Our comprehensive empirical results show that AS2P is highly effective in optimizing objectives for large deep models, including language models, and outperforms standard methods across various model types and scales, with 2 $\times$ speed-up in training over most conducted tasks. et.al.|[2402.01621](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01621)|null|
|**2024-02-02**|**MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs Improves Reasoning in Smaller Language Models**|Multi-agent interactions between Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown major improvements on diverse reasoning tasks. However, these involve long generations from multiple models across several rounds, making them expensive. Moreover, these multi-agent approaches fail to provide a final, single model for efficient inference. To address this, we introduce MAGDi, a new method for structured distillation of the reasoning interactions between multiple LLMs into smaller LMs. MAGDi teaches smaller models by representing multi-agent interactions as graphs, augmenting a base student model with a graph encoder, and distilling knowledge using three objective functions: next-token prediction, a contrastive loss between correct and incorrect reasoning, and a graph-based objective to model the interaction structure. Experiments on seven widely-used commonsense and math reasoning benchmarks show that MAGDi improves the reasoning capabilities of smaller models, outperforming several methods that distill from a single teacher and multiple teachers. Moreover, MAGDi also demonstrates an order of magnitude higher efficiency over its teachers. We conduct extensive analyses to show that MAGDi (1) enhances the generalizability to out-of-domain tasks, (2) scales positively with the size and strength of the base student model, and (3) obtains larger improvements (via our multi-teacher training) when applying self-consistency - an inference technique that relies on model diversity. et.al.|[2402.01620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01620)|**[link](https://github.com/dinobby/magdi)**|
|**2024-02-02**|**KB-Plugin: A Plug-and-play Framework for Large Language Models to Induce Programs over Low-resourced Knowledge Bases**|Program induction (PI) has become a promising paradigm for using knowledge bases (KBs) to help large language models (LLMs) answer complex knowledge-intensive questions. Nonetheless, PI typically relies on a large number of parallel question-program pairs to make the LLM aware of the schema of the given KB, and is thus challenging for many low-resourced KBs that lack annotated data. To this end, we propose KB-Plugin, a plug-and-play framework that enables LLMs to induce programs over any low-resourced KB. Firstly, KB-Plugin adopts self-supervised learning to encode the detailed schema information of a given KB into a pluggable module, namely schema plugin. Secondly, KB-Plugin utilizes abundant annotated data from a rich-resourced KB to train another pluggable module, namely PI plugin, which can help the LLM extract question-relevant schema information from the schema plugin of any KB and utilize this information to induce programs over this KB. Experiments on five heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that KB-Plugin achieves better or comparable performance with 25 $\times$ smaller backbone LLM compared to SoTA PI methods for low-resourced KBs, and even approaches the performance of supervised methods.

However, they exhibit numerous limitations that prevent their broader adoption in many real-world systems, which often require a higher bar for trustworthiness and usability. Since FMs are trained using loss functions aimed at reconstructing the training corpus in a self-supervised manner, there is no guarantee that the model's output aligns with users' preferences for a specific task at hand. In this survey paper, we propose a conceptual framework that encapsulates different modes by which agents could interact with FMs and guide them suitably for a set of tasks, particularly through knowledge augmentation and reasoning. Our framework elucidates agent role categories such as updating the underlying FM, assisting with prompting the FM, and evaluating the FM output. We also categorize several state-of-the-art approaches into agent interaction protocols, highlighting the nature and extent of involvement of the various agent roles. The proposed framework provides guidance for future directions to further realize the power of FMs in practical AI systems. et.al.|[2402.01602](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01602)|null|

In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments. et.al.|[2402.01591](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01591)|null|

But do LLMs actually support user creativity? We hypothesized that the use of an LLM as a CST might make the LLM's users feel more creative, and even broaden the range of ideas suggested by each individual user, but also homogenize the ideas suggested by different users. We conducted a 36-participant comparative user study and found, in accordance with the homogenization hypothesis, that different users tended to produce less semantically distinct ideas with ChatGPT than with an alternative CST. Additionally, ChatGPT users generated a greater number of more detailed ideas, but felt less responsible for the ideas they generated. We discuss potential implications of these findings for users, designers, and developers of LLM-based CSTs. et.al.|[2402.01536](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01536)|null|
|**2024-02-02**|**Decoding Speculative Decoding**|Speculative Decoding is a widely used technique to speed up inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying its outcome. When performing inference on an LLM, speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model which generates speculative tokens and then uses the target LLM to verify those draft tokens. The speedup provided by speculative decoding heavily depends on the choice of the draft model. It has been widely suggested to select a draft model that provides a high probability of the generated token being accepted by the LLM to achieve the highest throughput. However, our experiments indicate the contrary with throughput diminishing as the probability of generated tokens to be accepted by the target model increases. To understand this phenomenon, we perform extensive experiments to characterize the different factors that affect speculative decoding and how those factors interact and affect the speedups. Based on our experiments we describe an analytical model which can be used to decide the right draft model for a given workload. Further, using our insights we design a new draft model for LLaMA-65B which can provide 30% higher throughput than existing draft models. et.al.|[2402.01528](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01528)|null|
|**2024-02-02**|**K-Level Reasoning with Large Language Models**|While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in complex reasoning tasks, their performance in dynamic, interactive, and competitive scenarios - such as business strategy and stock market analysis - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally explore the dynamic reasoning capabilities of LLMs for decision-making in rapidly evolving environments. We introduce two game theory-based pilot challenges that mirror the complexities of real-world dynamic decision-making. These challenges are well-defined, enabling clear, controllable, and precise evaluation of LLMs' dynamic reasoning abilities. Through extensive experiments, we find that existing reasoning methods tend to falter in dynamic settings that require k-level thinking - a key concept not tackled by previous works. To address this, we propose a novel reasoning approach for LLMs, named "K-Level Reasoning". This approach adopts the perspective of rivals to recursively employ k-level thinking based on available historical information, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy of rivals' subsequent moves and informs more strategic decision-making. This research not only sets a robust quantitative benchmark for the assessment of dynamic reasoning but also markedly enhances the proficiency of LLMs in dynamic contexts. et.al.|[2402.01521](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01521)|null|
|**2024-02-01**|**Evaluating Large Language Models for Generalization and Robustness via Data Compression**|Existing methods for evaluating large language models face challenges such as data contamination, sensitivity to prompts, and the high cost of benchmark creation. To address this, we propose a lossless data compression based evaluation approach that tests how models' predictive abilities generalize after their training cutoff. Specifically, we collect comprehensive test data spanning 83 months from 2017 to 2023 and split the data into training and testing periods according to models' training data cutoff. We measure: 1) the compression performance on the testing period as a measure of generalization on unseen data; and 2) the performance gap between the training and testing period as a measure of robustness. Our experiments test 14 representative large language models with various sizes on sources including Wikipedia, news articles, code, arXiv papers, and multi-modal data. We find that the compression rate of many models reduces significantly after their cutoff date, but models such as Mistral and Llama-2 demonstrate a good balance between performance and robustness. Results also suggest that models struggle to generalize on news and code data, but work especially well on arXiv papers. We also find the context size and tokenization implementation have a big impact of on the overall compression performance. et.al.|[2402.00861](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00861)|null|
|**2024-02-01**|**Can Large Language Models Understand Context?**|Understanding context is key to understanding human language, an ability which Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly seen to demonstrate to an impressive extent. However, though the evaluation of LLMs encompasses various domains within the realm of Natural Language Processing, limited attention has been paid to probing their linguistic capability of understanding contextual features. This paper introduces a context understanding benchmark by adapting existing datasets to suit the evaluation of generative models. This benchmark comprises of four distinct tasks and nine datasets, all featuring prompts designed to assess the models' ability to understand context. First, we evaluate the performance of LLMs under the in-context learning pretraining scenario. Experimental results indicate that pre-trained dense models struggle with understanding more nuanced contextual features when compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Second, as LLM compression holds growing significance in both research and real-world applications, we assess the context understanding of quantized models under in-context-learning settings. We find that 3-bit post-training quantization leads to varying degrees of performance reduction on our benchmark. We conduct an extensive analysis of these scenarios to substantiate our experimental results. et.al.|[2402.00858](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00858)|null|

SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for data stream manipulation, aligning LLM outputs with user objectives. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models endowed with zero- and few-shot learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. In turn, the framework facilitates the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. We conclude by introducing a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short.

However, deploying LLMs in the real world is not trivial, as it requires substantial computing resources. In this paper, we investigate whether smaller, compact LLMs are a good alternative to the comparatively Larger LLMs2 to address significant costs associated with utilizing LLMs in the real world. In this regard, we study the meeting summarization task in a real-world industrial environment and conduct extensive experiments by comparing the performance of fine-tuned compact LLMs (e.g., FLAN-T5, TinyLLaMA, LiteLLaMA) with zero-shot larger LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2). We observe that most smaller LLMs, even after fine-tuning, fail to outperform larger zero-shot LLMs in meeting summarization datasets. However, a notable exception is FLAN-T5 (780M parameters), which performs on par or even better than many zero-shot Larger LLMs (from 7B to above 70B parameters), while being significantly smaller. This makes compact LLMs like FLAN-T5 a suitable cost-efficient solution for real-world industrial deployment. et.al.|[2402.00841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00841)|null|

|**2024-02-01**|**Formal-LLM: Integrating Formal Language and Natural Language for Controllable LLM-based Agents**|Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel ``Formal-LLM'' framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows human users to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

|**2024-02-01**|**LLMs learn governing principles of dynamical systems, revealing an in-context neural scaling law**|Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. In this paper, we study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs. et.al.|[2402.00795](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00795)|null|

To that end, we pioneer the approach of training an intrinsically bilingual model with a 1:1 English-to-French pretraining data ratio, a custom tokenizer, and bilingual finetuning datasets. We release the training dataset, notably containing a French split with manually curated, high-quality, and varied data sources. To assess performance outside of English, we craft a novel benchmark, FrenchBench, consisting of an array of classification and generation tasks, covering various orthogonal aspects of model performance in the French Language. Additionally, rooted in transparency and to foster further Large Language Model research, we release codebases, and dozens of checkpoints across various model sizes, training data distributions, and training steps, as well as fine-tuned Chat models, and strong translation models. We evaluate our model through the FMTI framework, and validate 81 % of the transparency criteria, far beyond the scores of even most open initiatives. This work enriches the NLP landscape, breaking away from previous English-centric work in order to strengthen our understanding of multilinguality in language models. et.al.|[2402.00786](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00786)|**[link](https://github.com/coderpat/croissant-llm-training)**|
|**2024-02-01**|**Dense Reward for Free in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been credited as the key advance that has allowed Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce useful assistance. Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many "actions" (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima. et.al.|[2402.00782](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00782)|**[link](https://github.com/xanderjc/attention-based-credit)**|
|**2024-02-01**|**Unlearnable Algorithms for In-context Learning**|Machine unlearning is a desirable operation as models get increasingly deployed on data with unknown provenance. However, achieving exact unlearning -- obtaining a model that matches the model distribution when the data to be forgotten was never used -- is challenging or inefficient, often requiring significant retraining. In this paper, we focus on efficient unlearning methods for the task adaptation phase of a pretrained large language model (LLM). We observe that an LLM's ability to do in-context learning for task adaptation allows for efficient exact unlearning of task adaptation training data. We provide an algorithm for selecting few-shot training examples to prepend to the prompt given to an LLM (for task adaptation), ERASE, whose unlearning operation cost is independent of model and dataset size, meaning it scales to large models and datasets. We additionally compare our approach to fine-tuning approaches and discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches. This leads us to propose a new holistic measure of unlearning cost which accounts for varying inference costs, and conclude that in-context learning can often be more favourable than fine-tuning for deployments involving unlearning requests. et.al.|[2402.00751](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00751)|null|
|**2024-01-31**|**Do Language Models Exhibit the Same Cognitive Biases in Problem Solving as Human Learners?**|There is increasing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) as cognitive models. For such purposes, it is central to understand which cognitive properties are well-modeled by LLMs, and which are not. In this work, we study the biases of LLMs in relation to those known in children when solving arithmetic word problems. Surveying the learning science literature, we posit that the problem-solving process can be split into three distinct steps: text comprehension, solution planning and solution execution. We construct tests for each one in order to understand which parts of this process can be faithfully modeled by current state-of-the-art LLMs. We generate a novel set of word problems for each of these tests, using a neuro-symbolic method that enables fine-grained control over the problem features. We find evidence that LLMs, with and without instruction-tuning, exhibit human-like biases in both the text-comprehension and the solution-planning steps of the solving process, but not during the final step which relies on the problem's arithmetic expressions (solution execution). et.al.|[2401.18070](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18070)|null|

To address this, we present LongAlign -- a recipe of the instruction data, training, and evaluation for long context alignment. First, we construct a long instruction-following dataset using Self-Instruct. To ensure the data diversity, it covers a broad range of tasks from various long context sources. Second, we adopt the packing and sorted batching strategies to speed up supervised fine-tuning on data with varied length distributions. Additionally, we develop a loss weighting method to balance the contribution to the loss across different sequences during packing training. Third, we introduce the LongBench-Chat benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities on queries of 10k-100k in length. Experiments show that LongAlign outperforms existing recipes for LLMs in long context tasks by up to 30\%, while also maintaining their proficiency in handling short, generic tasks.

It is a collection of auto-regressive monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual Indic language models pretrained from scratch on a single GPU for 10 Indian languages (Assamese, Bangla, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu) across 5 scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, Tamil, Telugu) of varying sizes ranging from 13.29M to 367.5M.The models are pretrained with a context size of 1024 on a single GPU. The models are very efficient, small, fast, and powerful. We have also developed an efficient most advanced Indic tokenizer that can even tokenize unseen languages. In order to avoid the "curse of multi-linguality" in our multilingual mParamanu model, we pretrained on comparable corpora by typological grouping using the same script. We performed human evaluation of our pretrained models for open end text generation on grammar, coherence, creativity, and factuality metrics for Bangla, Hindi, and Sanskrit. Our Bangla, Hindi, and Sanskrit models outperformed GPT-3.5-Turbo (ChatGPT), Bloom 7B, LLaMa-2 7B, OPT 6.7B, GPT-J 6B, GPTNeo 1.3B, GPT2-XL large language models (LLMs) by a large margin despite being smaller in size by 66 to 20 times compared to standard 7B LLMs. To run inference on our pretrained models, CPU is enough, and GPU is not needed. We also instruction-tuned our pretrained Bangla, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu models on 23k instructions in respective languages. Our pretrained and instruction-tuned models which are first of its kind, most powerful efficient small generative language models ever developed for Indic languages, and the various results lead to the conclusion that high quality generative language models are possible without high amount of compute power and humongous number of parameters.

|**2024-01-31**|**Supporting Anticipatory Governance using LLMs: Evaluating and Aligning Large Language Models with the News Media to Anticipate the Negative Impacts of AI**|Anticipating the negative impacts of emerging AI technologies is a challenge, especially in the early stages of development. An understudied approach to such anticipation is the use of LLMs to enhance and guide this process. Despite advancements in LLMs and evaluation metrics to account for biases in generated text, it is unclear how well these models perform in anticipatory tasks. Specifically, the use of LLMs to anticipate AI impacts raises questions about the quality and range of categories of negative impacts these models are capable of generating. In this paper we leverage news media, a diverse data source that is rich with normative assessments of emerging technologies, to formulate a taxonomy of impacts to act as a baseline for comparing against. By computationally analyzing thousands of news articles published by hundreds of online news domains around the world, we develop a taxonomy consisting of ten categories of AI impacts. We then evaluate both instruction-based (GPT-4 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) and fine-tuned completion models (Mistral-7B and GPT-3) using a sample from this baseline. We find that the generated impacts using Mistral-7B, fine-tuned on impacts from the news media, tend to be qualitatively on par with impacts generated using a larger scale model such as GPT-4. Moreover, we find that these LLMs generate impacts that largely reflect the taxonomy of negative impacts identified in the news media, however the impacts produced by instruction-based models had gaps in the production of certain categories of impacts in comparison to fine-tuned models. This research highlights a potential bias in state-of-the-art LLMs when used for anticipating impacts and demonstrates the advantages of aligning smaller LLMs with a diverse range of impacts, such as those reflected in the news media, to better reflect such impacts during anticipatory exercises. et.al.|[2401.18028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18028)|null|
|**2024-01-31**|**Prompt-Driven LLM Safeguarding via Directed Representation Optimization**|Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice of safeguarding large language models (LLMs) from complying with queries that contain harmful intents. However, the working mechanisms of safety prompts have not yet been fully understood, which hinders the potential for automatically optimizing them for improved LLM safety. Motivated by this problem, we investigate the impact of safety prompts from the perspective of model representations. We find that in models' representation space, harmful and harmless queries can be largely distinguished, but this is not noticeably enhanced by safety prompts. Instead, the queries' representations are moved by different safety prompts in similar directions, where models become more prone to refusal (i.e., refusing to provide assistance) even when the queries are harmless. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method called DRO (Directed Representation Optimization) for automatic safety prompt optimization. DRO treats safety prompts as continuous, trainable embeddings and learns to move the representations of harmful/harmless queries along/opposite the direction in which the model's refusal probability increases. We demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts and outperforms strong baselines, as evaluated on out-of-domain benchmarks, without compromising the general model capability. et.al.|[2401.18018](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018)|**[link](https://github.com/chujiezheng/llm-safeguard)**|

This siloed approach limits the development EEG ML models that exhibit multi-scale electrophysiological understanding and classification capabilities. Moreover, typical ML EEG approaches utilize black-box approaches, limiting their interpretability and trustworthiness in clinical contexts. Thus, we propose EEG-GPT, a unifying approach to EEG classification that leverages advances in large language models (LLM). EEG-GPT achieves excellent performance comparable to current state-of-the-art deep learning methods in classifying normal from abnormal EEG in a few-shot learning paradigm utilizing only 2% of training data. Furthermore, it offers the distinct advantages of providing intermediate reasoning steps and coordinating specialist EEG tools across multiple scales in its operation, offering transparent and interpretable step-by-step verification, thereby promoting trustworthiness in clinical contexts. et.al.|[2401.18006](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18006)|null|

ACs facilitate the certification of systems in accordance with industrial standards, for example, DO-178C and ISO 26262. Identifying defeaters arguments that refute these ACs is essential for improving the robustness and confidence in ACs. To automate this task, we introduce a novel method that leverages the capabilities of GPT-4 Turbo, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, to identify defeaters within ACs formalized using the Eliminative Argumentation (EA) notation. Our initial evaluation gauges the model's proficiency in understanding and generating arguments within this framework. The findings indicate that GPT-4 Turbo excels in EA notation and is capable of generating various types of defeaters. et.al.|[2401.17991](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17991)|null|

This paper presents an empirical study on enhancing MLLMs with state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection and Optical Character Recognition models to improve fine-grained image understanding and reduce hallucination in responses. Our research investigates the embedding-based infusion of detection information, the impact of such infusion on the MLLMs' original abilities, and the interchangeability of detection models. We conduct systematic experiments with models such as LLaVA-1.5, DINO, and PaddleOCRv2, revealing that our approach not only refines MLLMs' performance in specific visual tasks but also maintains their original strengths. The resulting enhanced MLLMs outperform SOTA models on 9 out of 10 benchmarks, achieving an improvement of up to 12.99% on the normalized average score, marking a notable advancement in multimodal understanding.

ChatGPT, a large language model, is robust in many natural language processing tasks, including legal text entailment: when we set the temperature = 0 (the ChatGPT answers are deterministic) and prompt the model, it achieves 70.64% accuracy on COLIEE 2022 dataset, which outperforms the previous SOTA of 67.89%. On the other hand, if the temperature is larger than zero, ChatGPT answers are not deterministic, leading to inconsistent answers and fluctuating results. We propose to leverage label models (a fundamental component of weak supervision techniques) to integrate the provisional answers by ChatGPT into consolidated labels. By that way, we treat ChatGPT provisional answers as noisy predictions which can be consolidated by label models. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach can attain an accuracy of 76.15%, marking a significant improvement of 8.26% over the prior state-of-the-art benchmark. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the instances where ChatGPT produces incorrect answers, then we classify the errors, offering insights that could guide potential enhancements for future research endeavors. et.al.|[2401.17897](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17897)|null|

We define awareness in LLMs as the ability to perceive and understand themselves as AI models and to exhibit social intelligence. We identify four key dimensions of awareness: capability, mission, emotion, and perspective. To assess LLMs on these dimensions, we introduce a specialized dataset, AwareLLM dataset.

We then fine-tune Weaver for creative and professional writing purposes and align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of novel methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able to produce more human-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for content creation. The Weaver family consists of models of Weaver Mini (1.8B), Weaver Base (6B), Weaver Pro (14B), and Weaver Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable for different applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent according to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost.

Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultra model surpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writing scenarios, demonstrating the advantage of training specialized LLMs for writing purposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling (tool usage).

|**2024-01-30**|**Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models**|Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding. Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations. This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B). To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs. The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations. Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of multiple data-aware reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that dynamically interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP). Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates an ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structures and elastic tensors), and summarize multi-step procedures for solid-state synthesis. We show that LLaMP effectively corrects errors in GPT-3.5's intrinsic knowledge, reducing a 5.21% MAPE on frequently-documented bandgaps and a significant 1103.54% MAPE on formation energies -- errors that GPT-3.5 seems to derive from mixed data sources. Additionally, LLaMP substantially reduces the hallucinated volumetric strain in a diamond cubic silicon structure from 66.3% to 0. The proposed framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring materials informatics and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models. We envision the framework as a valuable component for scientific hypotheses and a foundation for future autonomous laboratories where multiple LLM agents communicate and cooperate with robotics to drive material synthesis and chemical reactions without hard-coded human logic and intervention. et.al.|[2401.17244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17244)|null|

|**2024-01-30**|**Data-efficient Fine-tuning for LLM-based Recommendation**|Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation. However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application. To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data. We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning. While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.   To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process. To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score. Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%. et.al.|[2401.17197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17197)|null|

We are particularly interested to see whether pretrained AR models can be transformed into text diffusion models through a lightweight adaptation procedure we call ``AR2Diff''. We begin by establishing a strong baseline setup for training text diffusion models. Comparing across multiple architectures and pretraining objectives, we find that training a decoder-only model with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks. Building on this finding, we test various transfer learning setups for text diffusion models. On machine translation, we find that text diffusion underperforms the standard AR approach. However, on code synthesis and extractive QA, we find diffusion models trained from scratch outperform AR models in many cases. We also observe quality gains from AR2Diff -- adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding. These results are promising given that text diffusion is relatively underexplored and can be significantly faster than AR decoding for long text generation. et.al.|[2401.17181](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17181)|null|

In this paper, we probe the extent to which a dozen LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king'). These inference patterns have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they plausibly play a central role in human reasoning. Assessing LLMs on these inference patterns is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. Among the LLMs we tested, all but GPT-4 often make basic mistakes with conditionals. Moreover, even GPT-4 displays logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals. et.al.|[2401.17169](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17169)|null|

However, existing benchmarks typically focus on simple synthesized queries that do not reflect real-world complexity, thereby offering limited perspectives in evaluating tool utilization. To address this issue, we present UltraTool, a novel benchmark designed to improve and evaluate LLMs' ability in tool utilization within real-world scenarios. UltraTool focuses on the entire process of using tools - from planning and creating to applying them in complex tasks. It emphasizes real-world complexities, demanding accurate, multi-step planning for effective problem-solving. A key feature of UltraTool is its independent evaluation of planning with natural language, which happens before tool usage and simplifies the task solving by mapping out the intermediate steps. Thus, unlike previous work, it eliminates the restriction of pre-defined toolset during planning.

To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefits than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workflow. We found significant differences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for human-AI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the benefit gap. We identified guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLM-based interfaces to support the programming of ABM. et.al.|[2401.17163](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17163)|null|
|**2024-01-30**|**Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Entropy**|Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, extending their strong capabilities into multi-modal domains. Thus, it is vital to define proper and diversified metrics for the evaluation of LLMs.   In this paper, we introduce matrix entropy, a novel metric rooted in information theory and geometry principles to quantify the data compression proficiency in LLMs. It reflects the model's ability to extract relevant information and eliminate unnecessary elements, thereby providing insight into the language model's intrinsic capability. Specifically, we demonstrate its applicability in both single-modal (language) and multi-modal settings. For language models, our findings reveal that the matrix entropy of representations follows a scaling law type reduction when the model scales up, serving as a complement to the traditional loss scaling law. For the multi-modal setting, we also propose an evaluation method based on matrix entropy for assessing alignment quality and we find that modern large multi-modal models exhibit great alignment performance. et.al.|[2401.17139](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17139)|**[link](https://github.com/waltonfuture/matrix-entropy)**|
|**2024-01-29**|**Scaling Sparse Fine-Tuning to Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to fully fine-tune (e.g., with instructions or human feedback) due to their sheer number of parameters. A family of parameter-efficient sparse fine-tuning (SFT) methods have proven promising in terms of performance but their memory requirements increase proportionally to the size of the LLMs. In this work, we scale sparse fine-tuning to state-of-the-art LLMs like LLaMA 2 7B and 13B. At any given time, for a desired density level, we maintain an array of parameter indices and the deltas of these parameters relative to their pretrained values. We iterate among: (a) updating the active deltas, (b) pruning indices (based on the change of magnitude of their deltas) and (c) regrowth of indices. For regrowth, we explore two criteria based on either the accumulated gradients of a few candidate parameters or their approximate momenta estimated using the efficient SM3 optimizer. We experiment with instruction-tuning of LLMs on standard dataset mixtures, finding that SFT is often superior to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (low-rank adaptation) in terms of performance and comparable in terms of run time. We additionally show that SFT is compatible with both quantization and efficient optimizers, to facilitate scaling to ever-larger model sizes. We release the code for SFT at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/peft and for the instruction-tuning experiments at https://github.com/ducdauge/sft-llm. et.al.|[2401.16405](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16405)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**Rephrasing the Web: A Recipe for Compute and Data-Efficient Language Modeling**|Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training ( $\textbf{WRAP}$) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as "like Wikipedia" or in "question-answer format" to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by $\sim3x$ . At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 10% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data has higher utility than just real data because it (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher 'quality' than web-scraped data. et.al.|[2401.16380](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16380)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**The role of library versions in Developer-ChatGPT conversations**|The latest breakthroughs in large language models (LLM) have empowered software development tools, such as ChatGPT, to aid developers in complex tasks. Developers use ChatGPT to write code, review code changes, and even debug their programs. In these interactions, ChatGPT often recommends code snippets that depend on external libraries. However, code from libraries changes over time, invalidating a once-correct code snippet and making it difficult to reuse recommended code.   In this study, we analyze DevGPT, a dataset of more than 4,000 Developer-ChatGPT interactions, to understand the role of library versions in code-related conversations. We quantify how often library version constraints are mentioned in code-related conversations and when ChatGPT recommends the installation of specific libraries. Our findings show that, albeit to constantly recommend and analyze code with external dependencies, library version constraints only appear in 9% of the conversations. In the majority of conversations, the version constraints are prompted by users (as opposed to being specified by ChatGPT) as a method for receiving better quality responses. Moreover, we study how library version constraints are used in the conversation through qualitative methods, identifying several potential problems that warrant further research. et.al.|[2401.16340](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16340)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**Machine Translation Meta Evaluation through Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets**|Recent machine translation (MT) metrics calibrate their effectiveness by correlating with human judgement but without any insights about their behaviour across different error types. Challenge sets are used to probe specific dimensions of metric behaviour but there are very few such datasets and they either focus on a limited number of phenomena or a limited number of language pairs. We introduce ACES, a contrastive challenge set spanning 146 language pairs, aimed at discovering whether metrics can identify 68 translation accuracy errors. These phenomena range from simple alterations at the word/character level to more complex errors based on discourse and real-world knowledge. We conduct a large-scale study by benchmarking ACES on 50 metrics submitted to the WMT 2022 and 2023 metrics shared tasks. We benchmark metric performance, assess their incremental performance over successive campaigns, and measure their sensitivity to a range of linguistic phenomena. We also investigate claims that Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective as MT evaluators by evaluating on ACES. Our results demonstrate that different metric families struggle with different phenomena and that LLM-based methods fail to demonstrate reliable performance. Our analyses indicate that most metrics ignore the source sentence, tend to prefer surface-level overlap and end up incorporating properties of base models which are not always beneficial. We expand ACES to include error span annotations, denoted as SPAN-ACES and we use this dataset to evaluate span-based error metrics showing these metrics also need considerable improvement. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for building better MT metrics, including focusing on error labels instead of scores, ensembling, designing strategies to explicitly focus on the source sentence, focusing on semantic content and choosing the right base model for representations. et.al.|[2401.16313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16313)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**Security Code Review by LLMs: A Deep Dive into Responses**|Security code review aims to combine automated tools and manual efforts to detect security defects during development. The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising potential in software development, as well as opening up new possibilities in automated security code review. To explore the challenges of applying LLMs in practical code review for security defect detection, this study compared the detection performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini Pro, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5) under five prompts on 549 code files that contain security defects from real-world code reviews. Through analyzing 82 responses generated by the best-performing LLM-prompt combination based on 100 randomly selected code files, we extracted and categorized quality problems present in these responses into 5 themes and 16 categories. Our results indicate that the responses produced by LLMs often suffer from verbosity, vagueness, and incompleteness, highlighting the necessity to enhance their conciseness, understandability, and compliance to security defect detection. This work reveals the deficiencies of LLM-generated responses in security code review and paves the way for future optimization of LLMs towards this task. et.al.|[2401.16310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16310)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**CO2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap**|The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections. et.al.|[2401.16265](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16265)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**An Empirical Study on Usage and Perceptions of LLMs in a Software Engineering Project**|Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a leap in artificial intelligence, excelling in tasks using human language(s). Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain. However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members. Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.   In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective. Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging. These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration. et.al.|[2401.16186](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16186)|null|
|**2024-01-29**|**LLM4Vuln: A Unified Evaluation Framework for Decoupling and Enhancing LLMs' Vulnerability Reasoning**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant poten- tial for many downstream tasks, including those requiring human- level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection. However, recent attempts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection are still prelim- inary, as they lack an in-depth understanding of a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability - whether it originates from the model itself or from external assistance, such as invoking tool sup- port and retrieving vulnerability knowledge. In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reason- ing capability from their other capabilities, including the ability to actively seek additional information (e.g., via function calling in SOTA models), adopt relevant vulnerability knowledge (e.g., via vector-based matching and retrieval), and follow instructions to out- put structured results. To this end, we propose a unified evaluation framework named LLM4Vuln, which separates LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from their other capabilities and evaluates how LLMs' vulnerability reasoning could be enhanced when combined with the enhancement of other capabilities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM4Vuln, we have designed controlled experiments using 75 ground-truth smart contract vulnerabilities, which were extensively audited as high-risk on Code4rena from August to November 2023, and tested them in 4,950 different scenarios across three represen- tative LLMs (GPT-4, Mixtral, and Code Llama). Our results not only reveal ten findings regarding the varying effects of knowledge en- hancement, context supplementation, prompt schemes, and models but also enable us to identify 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in two pilot bug bounty programs with over 1,000 USD being awarded. et.al.|[2401.16185](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16185)|null|

To address this issue, we share a dataset containing text-based user interactions related to behaviour change with two GPT-4-based conversational agents collected in a preregistered user study. This dataset includes conversation data, user language analysis, perception measures, and user feedback for LLM-generated turns, and can offer valuable insights to inform the design of such systems based on real interactions. et.al.|[2401.16167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16167)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**EAGLE: Speculative Sampling Requires Rethinking Feature Uncertainty**|Auto-regressive decoding makes the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) time-consuming. We propose a simple framework, EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater Language-model Efficiency), for lossless acceleration. Unlike traditional speculative sampling methods, EAGLE operates the drafting process auto-regressively at the more regular (second-top-layer) feature level and addresses the sampling uncertainty issues in the next-feature prediction problems by integrating tokens from one time step ahead. The acceleration provided by EAGLE is lossless: it involves no fine-tuning of the target LLM, and the generated text maintains the same distribution as that of vanilla auto-regressive decoding. As of the submission of this paper, EAGLE is the fastest known framework within the speculative sampling family. On MT-bench, EAGLE is 3x faster than vanilla decoding, 2x faster than Lookahead, and 1.6x faster than Medusa. Using gpt-fast, EAGLE attains on average 160 tokens/s with LLaMA2-Chat 13B on a single RTX 3090 GPU, compared to 24 tokens/s of Huggingface's implementations. et.al.|[2401.15077](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15077)|null|

However, there is still a wide gap between the performance of recent MLLM-based applications and the expectation of the broad public, even though the most powerful OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini have been deployed. This paper strives to enhance understanding of the gap through the lens of a qualitative study on the generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning capabilities of recent proprietary and open-source MLLMs across four modalities: ie, text, code, image, and video, ultimately aiming to improve the transparency of MLLMs. We believe these properties are several representative factors that define the reliability of MLLMs, in supporting various downstream applications. To be specific, we evaluate the closed-source GPT-4 and Gemini and 6 open-source LLMs and MLLMs. Overall we evaluate 230 manually designed cases, where the qualitative results are then summarized into 12 scores (ie, 4 modalities times 3 properties). In total, we uncover 14 empirical findings that are useful to understand the capabilities and limitations of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs, towards more reliable downstream multi-modal applications. et.al.|[2401.15071](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15071)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**Health Text Simplification: An Annotated Corpus for Digestive Cancer Education and Novel Strategies for Reinforcement Learning**|Objective: The reading level of health educational materials significantly influences information understandability and accessibility, particularly for minoritized populations. Many patient educational resources surpass the reading level and complexity of widely accepted standards. There is a critical need for high-performing text simplification models in health information to enhance dissemination and literacy. This need is particularly acute in cancer education, where effective prevention and screening education can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.   Methods: We introduce Simplified Digestive Cancer (SimpleDC), a parallel corpus of cancer education materials tailored for health text simplification research. Utilizing SimpleDC alongside the existing Med-EASi corpus, we explore Large Language Model (LLM)-based simplification methods, including fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), domain adaptation, and prompt-based approaches. Our experimentation encompasses Llama 2 and GPT-4. A novel RLHF reward function is introduced, featuring a lightweight model adept at distinguishing between original and simplified texts, thereby enhancing the model's effectiveness with unlabeled data.   Results: Fine-tuned Llama 2 models demonstrated high performance across various metrics. Our innovative RLHF reward function surpassed existing RL text simplification reward functions in effectiveness. The results underscore that RL/RLHF can augment fine-tuning, facilitating model training on unlabeled text and improving performance. Additionally, these methods effectively adapt out-of-domain text simplification models to targeted domains. et.al.|[2401.15043](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15043)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**PROXYQA: An Alternative Framework for Evaluating Long-Form Text Generation with Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in long-form context comprehension tasks. However, their capacity to generate long contents, such as reports and articles, remains insufficiently explored. Current benchmarks do not adequately assess LLMs' ability to produce informative and comprehensive content, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation approach. In this study, we introduce \textsc{ProxyQA}, a framework for evaluating long-form text generation, comprising in-depth human-curated \textit{meta-questions} spanning various domains. Each meta-question contains corresponding \textit{proxy-questions} with annotated answers. LLMs are prompted to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions. Utilizing an evaluator and incorporating generated content as background context, \textsc{ProxyQA} evaluates the quality of generated content based on the evaluator's performance in answering the \textit{proxy-questions}. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing \textsc{ProxyQA}'s demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that evaluating through \textit{proxy-questions} is a highly self-consistent and human-criteria-correlated validation method.

|**2024-01-26**|**On the generalization capacity of neural networks during generic multimodal reasoning**|The advent of the Transformer has led to the development of large language models (LLM), which appear to demonstrate human-like capabilities. To assess the generality of this class of models and a variety of other base neural network architectures to multimodal domains, we evaluated and compared their capacity for multimodal generalization. We introduce a multimodal question-answer benchmark to evaluate three specific types of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance: distractor generalization (generalization in the presence of distractors), systematic compositional generalization (generalization to new task permutations), and productive compositional generalization (generalization to more complex tasks structures). We found that across model architectures (e.g., RNNs, Transformers, Perceivers, etc.), models with multiple attention layers, or models that leveraged cross-attention mechanisms between input domains, fared better. Our positive results demonstrate that for multimodal distractor and systematic generalization, either cross-modal attention or models with deeper attention layers are key architectural features required to integrate multimodal inputs. On the other hand, neither of these architectural features led to productive generalization, suggesting fundamental limitations of existing architectures for specific types of multimodal generalization. These results demonstrate the strengths and limitations of specific architectural components underlying modern neural models for multimodal reasoning. Finally, we provide Generic COG (gCOG), a configurable benchmark with several multimodal generalization splits, for future studies to explore. et.al.|[2401.15030](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15030)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**SliceGPT: Compress Large Language Models by Deleting Rows and Columns**|Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.

|**2024-01-26**|**Reassessing Java Code Readability Models with a Human-Centered Approach**|To ensure that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively support user productivity, they need to be adjusted. Existing Code Readability (CR) models can guide this alignment. However, there are concerns about their relevance in modern software engineering since they often miss the developers' notion of readability and rely on outdated code. This research assesses existing Java CR models for LLM adjustments, measuring the correlation between their and developers' evaluations of AI-generated Java code. Using the Repertory Grid Technique with 15 developers, we identified 12 key code aspects influencing CR that were consequently assessed by 390 programmers when labeling 120 AI-generated snippets. Our findings indicate that when AI generates concise and executable code, it is often considered readable by CR models and developers. However, a limited correlation between these evaluations underscores the importance of future research on learning objectives for adjusting LLMs and on the aspects influencing CR evaluations included in predictive models. et.al.|[2401.14936](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14936)|null|

With the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), HRI researchers are called to consider language appropriateness when using such generated language for robotic mental well-being coaches in the real world. Therefore, this paper presents the first work that investigated the language appropriateness of robot mental well-being coach in the workplace. To this end, we conducted an empirical study that involved 17 employees who interacted over 4 weeks with a robotic mental well-being coach equipped with LLM-based capabilities. After the study, we individually interviewed them and we conducted a focus group of 1.5 hours with 11 of them. The focus group consisted of: i) an ice-breaking activity, ii) evaluation of robotic coach language appropriateness in various scenarios, and iii) listing shoulds and shouldn'ts for designing appropriate robotic coach language for mental well-being. From our qualitative evaluation, we found that a language-appropriate robotic coach should (1) ask deep questions which explore feelings of the coachees, rather than superficial questions, (2) express and show emotional and empathic understanding of the context, and (3) not make any assumptions without clarifying with follow-up questions to avoid bias and stereotyping.

The performance of these models relies on the high number of parameters of the underlying neural architectures, which allows LLMs to memorize part of the vast quantity of data seen during the training. This paper investigates whether and to what extent general-purpose pre-trained LLMs have memorized information from known ontologies. Our results show that LLMs partially know ontologies: they can, and do indeed, memorize concepts from ontologies mentioned in the text, but the level of memorization of their concepts seems to vary proportionally to their popularity on the Web, the primary source of their training material. We additionally propose new metrics to estimate the degree of memorization of ontological information in LLMs by measuring the consistency of the output produced across different prompt repetitions, query languages, and degrees of determinism. et.al.|[2401.14931](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14931)|null|
|**2024-01-26**|**The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems**|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems represent a significant advancement over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG systems enhance their generation ability by incorporating external data retrieved through an Information Retrieval (IR) phase, overcoming the limitations of standard LLMs, which are restricted to their pre-trained knowledge and limited context window. Most research in this area has predominantly concentrated on the generative aspect of LLMs within RAG systems. Our study fills this gap by thoroughly and critically analyzing the influence of IR components on RAG systems. This paper analyzes which characteristics a retriever should possess for an effective RAG's prompt formulation, focusing on the type of documents that should be retrieved. We evaluate various elements, such as the relevance of the documents to the prompt, their position, and the number included in the context. Our findings reveal, among other insights, that including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly enhance performance by more than 30% in accuracy, contradicting our initial assumption of diminished quality. These findings call for developing specialized approaches tailored to the specific demands of integrating retrieval with language generation models and pave the way for future research. These results underscore the need for developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with language generation models, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this field. et.al.|[2401.14887](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14887)|null|

|**2024-01-25**|**Topologies of Reasoning: Demystifying Chains, Trees, and Graphs of Thoughts**|The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges.

|**2024-01-25**|**RomanSetu: Efficiently unlocking multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models models via Romanization**|This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages, specifically those using non-Latin scripts. We propose an innovative approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Focusing on Hindi, we demonstrate through Hindi-to-English translation and sentiment analysis tasks that romanized text not only significantly improves inference efficiency due to its lower fertility compared to native text but also achieves competitive performance with limited pre-training. Additionally, our novel multi-script prompting approach, which combines romanized and native texts, shows promise in further enhancing task performance. These findings suggest the potential of romanization in bridging the language gap for LLM applications, with future work aimed at expanding this approach to more languages and tasks. et.al.|[2401.14280](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14280)|null|
|**2024-01-25**|**ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code Snippets using ChatGPT**|Technical question and answering (Q&A) sites such as Stack Overflow have become an important source for software developers to seek knowledge. However, code snippets on Q&A sites are usually uncompilable and semantically incomplete for compilation due to unresolved types and missing dependent libraries, which raises the obstacle for users to reuse or analyze Q&A code snippets. Prior approaches either are not designed for synthesizing compilable code or suffer from a low compilation success rate. To address this problem, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach to perform zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete code snippets using Large Language Model (LLM). ZS4C operates in two stages. In the first stage, ZS4C utilizes an LLM, i.e., ChatGPT, to identify missing import statements for a given code snippet, leveraging our designed task-specific prompt template. In the second stage, ZS4C fixes compilation errors caused by incorrect import statements and syntax errors through collaborative work between ChatGPT and a compiler. We thoroughly evaluated ZS4C on a widely used benchmark called StatType-SO against the SOTA approach SnR. Compared with SnR, ZS4C improves the compilation rate from 63% to 87.6%, with a 39.3% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements than SnR, with an improvement of 6.6% in the F1. et.al.|[2401.14279](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14279)|null|

However, these systems face challenges in their real-world usability, characterized by inefficiency and struggles in grasping user intentions. Leveraging recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce GptVoiceTasker, a virtual assistant poised to enhance user experiences and task efficiency on mobile devices. GptVoiceTasker excels at intelligently deciphering user commands and executing relevant device interactions to streamline task completion. The system continually learns from historical user commands to automate subsequent usages, further enhancing execution efficiency. Our experiments affirm GptVoiceTasker's exceptional command interpretation abilities and the precision of its task automation module. In our user study, GptVoiceTasker boosted task efficiency in real-world scenarios by 34.85%, accompanied by positive participant feedback.

|**2024-01-25**|**Transformers and Cortical Waves: Encoders for Pulling In Context Across Time**|The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence into a long "encoding vector" - that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, "self-attention" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity, traveling across single cortical regions or across multiple regions at the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers. et.al.|[2401.14267](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14267)|null|

Nonetheless, most existing works focus on boosting code LLMs from the perspective of programming capabilities, while their natural language capabilities receive less attention. To fill this gap, we thus propose a novel framework, comprising two modules: AttentionExtractor, which is responsible for extracting key phrases from the user's natural language requirements, and AttentionCoder, which leverages these extracted phrases to generate target code to solve the requirement. This framework pioneers an innovative idea by seamlessly integrating code LLMs with traditional natural language processing tools. To validate the effectiveness of the framework, we craft a new code generation benchmark, called MultiNL-H, covering five natural languages.

However, the predominance of closed-source models has restricted extensive research and development. To address this, we introduce the DeepSeek-Coder series, a range of open-source code models with sizes from 1.3B to 33B, trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens. These models are pre-trained on a high-quality project-level code corpus and employ a fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window to enhance code generation and infilling. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-Coder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models across multiple benchmarks but also surpasses existing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5.

The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods. et.al.|[2401.14192](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192)|null|

A First Look into Recognition, Soft Biometrics, and Explainability**|Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT developed by OpenAI, have already shown astonishing results, introducing quick changes in our society. This has been intensified by the release of ChatGPT which allows anyone to interact in a simple conversational way with LLMs, without any experience in the field needed. As a result, ChatGPT has been rapidly applied to many different tasks such as code- and song-writer, education, virtual assistants, etc., showing impressive results for tasks for which it was not trained (zero-shot learning).   The present study aims to explore the ability of ChatGPT, based on the recent GPT-4 multimodal LLM, for the task of face biometrics. In particular, we analyze the ability of ChatGPT to perform tasks such as face verification, soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability of the results. ChatGPT could be very valuable to further increase the explainability and transparency of the automatic decisions in human scenarios. Experiments are carried out in order to evaluate the performance and robustness of ChatGPT, using popular public benchmarks and comparing the results with state-of-the-art methods in the field. The results achieved in this study show the potential of LLMs such as ChatGPT for face biometrics, especially to enhance explainability.

Subsequently, we provide brief introductions of $26$ existing MM-LLMs, each characterized by its specific formulations. Additionally, we review the performance of MM-LLMs on mainstream benchmarks and summarize key training recipes to enhance the potency of MM-LLMs. Lastly, we explore promising directions for MM-LLMs while concurrently maintaining a real-time tracking website for the latest developments in the field.

|**2024-01-24**|**Consistency Guided Knowledge Retrieval and Denoising in LLMs for Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction**|Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document. Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data. However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations. In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK. Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge. Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets. The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines. et.al.|[2401.13598](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13598)|null|
|**2024-01-24**|**Graph Guided Question Answer Generation for Procedural Question-Answering**|In this paper, we focus on task-specific question answering (QA). To this end, we introduce a method for generating exhaustive and high-quality training data, which allows us to train compact (e.g., run on a mobile device), task-specific QA models that are competitive against GPT variants. The key technological enabler is a novel mechanism for automatic question-answer generation from procedural text which can ingest large amounts of textual instructions and produce exhaustive in-domain QA training data. While current QA data generation methods can produce well-formed and varied data, their non-exhaustive nature is sub-optimal for training a QA model. In contrast, we leverage the highly structured aspect of procedural text and represent each step and the overall flow of the procedure as graphs. We then condition on graph nodes to automatically generate QA pairs in an exhaustive and controllable manner. Comprehensive evaluations of our method show that: 1) small models trained with our data achieve excellent performance on the target QA task, even exceeding that of GPT3 and ChatGPT despite being several orders of magnitude smaller. 2) semantic coverage is the key indicator for downstream QA performance. Crucially, while large language models excel at syntactic diversity, this does not necessarily result in improvements on the end QA model. In contrast, the higher semantic coverage provided by our method is critical for QA performance. et.al.|[2401.13594](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13594)|null|
|**2024-01-24**|**Evaluation of General Large Language Models in Contextually Assessing Semantic Concepts Extracted from Adult Critical Care Electronic Health Record Notes**|The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance. However, their performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored. Traditional evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods, including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities. Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for LLMs is developed and operationalized. This framework goes beyond singular performance aspects. With expert annotations, this methodology not only validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains. et.al.|[2401.13588](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13588)|null|
|**2024-01-24**|**Fine-grained Contract NER using instruction based model**|Lately, instruction-based techniques have made significant strides in improving performance in few-shot learning scenarios. They achieve this by bridging the gap between pre-trained language models and fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in information extraction tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), using prompts or instructions, still falls short of supervised baselines. The reason for this performance gap can be attributed to the fundamental disparity between NER and LLMs. NER is inherently a sequence labeling task, where the model must assign entity-type labels to individual tokens within a sentence. In contrast, LLMs are designed as a text generation task. This distinction between semantic labeling and text generation leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we transform the NER task into a text-generation task that can be readily adapted by LLMs. This involves enhancing source sentences with task-specific instructions and answer choices, allowing for the identification of entities and their types within natural language. We harness the strength of LLMs by integrating supervised learning within them. The goal of this combined strategy is to boost the performance of LLMs in extraction tasks like NER while simultaneously addressing hallucination issues often observed in LLM-generated content. A novel corpus Contract NER comprising seven frequently observed contract categories, encompassing named entities associated with 18 distinct legal entity types is released along with our baseline models.

However, the prevailing information modeling process is encumbered by certain redundancies, leading to inefficiencies in speech generation. We propose Chain-of-Information Generation (CoIG), a method for decoupling semantic and perceptual information in large-scale speech generation. Building on this, we develop SpeechGPT-Gen, an 8-billion-parameter SLLM efficient in semantic and perceptual information modeling. It comprises an autoregressive model based on LLM for semantic information modeling and a non-autoregressive model employing flow matching for perceptual information modeling. Additionally, we introduce the novel approach of infusing semantic information into the prior distribution to enhance the efficiency of flow matching. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SpeechGPT-Gen markedly excels in zero-shot text-to-speech, zero-shot voice conversion, and speech-to-speech dialogue, underscoring CoIG's remarkable proficiency in capturing and modeling speech's semantic and perceptual dimensions.

In the field of tamper detection, LLMs are capable of identifying basic tampering activities.To assess the capabilities of LLMs in more specialized domains, we have collected five different LLMs developed by various companies: GPT-4, LLaMA, Bard, ERNIE Bot 4.0, and Tongyi Qianwen. This diverse range of models allows for a comprehensive evaluation of their performance in detecting sophisticated tampering instances.We devised two domains of detection: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) detection and manipulation detection. AIGC detection aims to test the ability to distinguish whether an image is real or AI-generated. Manipulation detection, on the other hand, focuses on identifying tampered images. According to our experiments, most LLMs can identify composite pictures that are inconsistent with logic, and only more powerful LLMs can distinguish logical, but visible signs of tampering to the human eye. All of the LLMs can't identify carefully forged images and very realistic images generated by AI. In the area of tamper detection, LLMs still have a long way to go, particularly in reliably identifying highly sophisticated forgeries and AI-generated images that closely mimic reality. et.al.|[2401.13504](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13504)|null|
|**2024-01-24**|**How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment**|Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- mimics the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI, and that participants were more likely to knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task was difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas into society may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity. et.al.|[2401.13481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481)|null|

However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role. To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain.

Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire, flood, and wind, and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents' decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments.

We introduce a method to detect AI-generated content by prompting LLMs to rewrite text and calculating the editing distance of the output. We dubbed our geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting method Raidar. Raidar significantly improves the F1 detection scores of existing AI content detection models -- both academic and commercial -- across various domains, including News, creative writing, student essays, code, Yelp reviews, and arXiv papers, with gains of up to 29 points.

However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such "in-the-wild" data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT's use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences. et.al.|[2401.12963](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12963)|null|
|**2024-01-23**|**Transformer-Based Models Are Not Yet Perfect At Learning to Emulate Structural Recursion**|This paper investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples. Recursion is a universal concept in both natural and formal languages. Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior. We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior. The framework includes a representation that captures the general \textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \textit{semantics} -- one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture.   With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups. The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution. In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations. Meanwhile, these LLMs fail in interesting ways when emulating reduction (step-wise computation) of the recursive function. et.al.|[2401.12947](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12947)|null|
|**2024-01-23**|**Red Teaming Visual Language Models**|VLMs (Vision-Language Models) extend the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) to accept multimodal inputs. Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question. To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 10 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jail-breaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness). Our RTVLM is the first red-teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects. Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data. This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment. Our code and datasets will be open-source. et.al.|[2401.12915](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12915)|null|

Extending LLMs with multimodal capabilities is the recent interest, but incurs computational cost and requires substantial hardware resources. To address these challenges, we propose KAM-CoT a framework that integrates CoT reasoning, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and multiple modalities for a comprehensive understanding of multimodal tasks. KAM-CoT adopts a two-stage training process with KG grounding to generate effective rationales and answers. By incorporating external knowledge from KGs during reasoning, the model gains a deeper contextual understanding reducing hallucinations and enhancing the quality of answers. This knowledge-augmented CoT reasoning empowers the model to handle questions requiring external context, providing more informed answers. Experimental findings show KAM-CoT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. On the ScienceQA dataset, we achieve an average accuracy of 93.87%, surpassing GPT-3.5 (75.17%) by 18% and GPT-4 (83.99%) by 10%.

The functionality of these services is to elicit the various knowledge ingredients that underlie SAX explanations. A key innovative component among these ingredients is the causal process execution view. In this work, we integrate the framework with an LLM to leverage its power to synthesize the various input ingredients for the sake of improved SAX explanations. Since the use of LLMs for SAX is also accompanied by a certain degree of doubt related to its capacity to adequately fulfill SAX along with its tendency for hallucination and lack of inherent capacity to reason, we pursued a methodological evaluation of the quality of the generated explanations. To this aim, we developed a designated scale and conducted a rigorous user study. Our findings show that the input presented to the LLMs aided with the guard-railing of its performance, yielding SAX explanations having better-perceived fidelity. This improvement is moderated by the perception of trust and curiosity. More so, this improvement comes at the cost of the perceived interpretability of the explanation. et.al.|[2401.12846](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12846)|null|
|**2024-01-23**|**Benchmarking LLMs via Uncertainty Quantification**|The proliferation of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from various institutions has highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive evaluation methods. However, current evaluation platforms, such as the widely recognized HuggingFace open LLM leaderboard, neglect a crucial aspect -- uncertainty, which is vital for thoroughly assessing LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmarking approach for LLMs that integrates uncertainty quantification. Our examination involves eight LLMs (LLM series) spanning five representative natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware evaluation metric, UAcc, which takes into account both prediction accuracy and prediction uncertainty. Our findings reveal that: I) LLMs with higher accuracy may exhibit lower certainty; II) Larger-scale LLMs may display greater uncertainty compared to their smaller counterparts; and III) Instruction-finetuning tends to increase the uncertainty of LLMs. By taking uncertainty into account, our new UAcc metric can either amplify or diminish the relative improvement of one LLM over another and may even change the relative ranking of two LLMs. These results underscore the significance of incorporating uncertainty in the evaluation of LLMs. et.al.|[2401.12794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12794)|null|

Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation study analyzes key parameters such as LLM size, context length, vocabulary size, fusion methodology. For instance, we explore the impact of LLM size ranging from 128M to 340B parameters on ASR performance.

|**2024-01-22**|**Less Could Be Better: Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Advances Medical Vision Foundation Models**|Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) that was initially developed for exploiting pre-trained large language models has recently emerged as an effective approach to perform transfer learning on computer vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of PEFT on medical vision foundation models is still unclear and remains to be explored. As a proof of concept, we conducted a detailed empirical study on applying PEFT to chest radiography foundation models. Specifically, we delved into LoRA, a representative PEFT method, and compared it against full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) on two self-supervised radiography foundation models across three well-established chest radiograph datasets. Our results showed that LoRA outperformed FFT in 13 out of 18 transfer learning tasks by at most 2.9% using fewer than 1% tunable parameters. Combining LoRA with foundation models, we set up new state-of-the-art on a range of data-efficient learning tasks, such as an AUROC score of 80.6% using 1% labeled data on NIH ChestX-ray14. We hope this study can evoke more attention from the community in the use of PEFT for transfer learning on medical imaging tasks.

|**2024-01-22**|**CheXagent: Towards a Foundation Model for Chest X-Ray Interpretation**|Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging test in clinical practice. Recent advances in the development of vision-language foundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated CXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. However, developing FMs that can accurately interpret CXRs is challenging due to the (1) limited availability of large-scale vision-language datasets in the medical image domain, (2) lack of vision and language encoders that can capture the complexities of medical data, and (3) absence of evaluation frameworks for benchmarking the abilities of FMs on CXR interpretation. In this work, we address these challenges by first introducing \emph{CheXinstruct} - a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset curated from 28 publicly-available datasets. We then present \emph{CheXagent} - an instruction-tuned FM capable of analyzing and summarizing CXRs. To build CheXagent, we design a clinical large language model (LLM) for parsing radiology reports, a vision encoder for representing CXR images, and a network to bridge the vision and language modalities. Finally, we introduce \emph{CheXbench} - a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate FMs across 8 clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks. Extensive quantitative evaluations and qualitative reviews with five expert radiologists demonstrate that CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs on CheXbench tasks. Furthermore, in an effort to improve model transparency, we perform a fairness evaluation across factors of sex, race and age to highlight potential performance disparities.

|**2024-01-22**|**APT: Adaptive Pruning and Tuning Pretrained Language Models for Efficient Training and Inference**|Fine-tuning and inference with large Language Models (LM) are generally known to be expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce APT that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of fine-tuning, APT dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up to 98% task performance when pruning RoBERTa and T5 models with 40% parameters left while keeping 86.4% LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters remained. Furthermore, APT speeds up LMs fine-tuning by up to 8x and reduces large LMs memory training footprint by up to 70%. et.al.|[2401.12200](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12200)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**Text Embedding Inversion Attacks on Multilingual Language Models**|Representing textual information as real-numbered embeddings has become the norm in NLP. Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a business model. This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them. However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. %As many international and multilingual companies leverage EaaS, there is an urgent need for research into multilingual LLM security. To this end, this work investigates LLM security from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion. Concretely, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario. Our findings reveal that multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than their monolingual counterparts. This stems from the reduced data requirements for achieving comparable inversion performance in settings where the underlying language is not known a-priori. To our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in the area of NLP Security. et.al.|[2401.12192](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12192)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**WARM: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged Reward Models**|Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy RL fine-tuned with a single RM. et.al.|[2401.12187](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12187)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**CodeTailor: Personalized Parsons Puzzles are Preferred Over AI-Generated Solutions to Support Learning**|Programming can be challenging for novices, but it is difficult to provide high-quality, comprehensive, and timely support at scale. Generative AI and its products, like ChatGPT, can create a solution for most introductory programming problems. However, students may become overly reliant on these tools for quick code generation and homework completion, leading to reduced engagement and limited learning. In this work, we present \sys{}, a system that utilizes large language models (LLM) while still promoting students' cognitive engagement. \sys{} provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students. In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with 800 incorrect student code demonstrated that \sys{} can efficiently create high-quality (correct, personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles for students. In a within-subjects experiment with 18 novice programmers, most students rated using \sys{} as more engaging, and they preferred \sys{} for learning rather than simply receiving an AI-generated solution. Additionally, students recalled more new elements from the supported practice to the posttest after using \sys{}, compared to when they simply received a direct solution. Qualitative observations and interviews provided evidence for the benefits of \sys{} including emphasizing algorithmic thinking, fostering continuity in learning, promoting metacognitive reflection, and boosting student confidence. We conclude by suggesting future designs for applying generative AI in a way that minimizes over-reliance and enhances learning. et.al.|[2401.12125](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12125)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**The Curious Case of Nonverbal Abstract Reasoning with Multi-Modal Large Language Models**|While large language models (LLMs) are still being adopted to new domains and utilized in novel applications, we are experiencing an influx of the new generation of foundation models, namely multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). These models integrate verbal and visual information, opening new possibilities to demonstrate more complex reasoning abilities at the intersection of the two modalities. However, despite the revolutionizing prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited. In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive Matrices. Our experiments expose the difficulty of solving such problems while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also reveal critical shortcomings with individual visual and textual modules, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings. Finally, to improve MLLMs' performance, we experiment with various methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, resulting in a significant (up to 100%) boost in performance. et.al.|[2401.12117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12117)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**An Empirical Analysis of In-context Learning Abilities of LLMs for MT**|In-context learning (ICL) has consistently demonstrated superior performance over zero-shot performance in large language models (LLMs). However, the understanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstream performance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilities of LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-context demonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). Our preliminary investigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) is predominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverse perturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the task instruction. We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across different model families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced by noise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend to show enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbed demonstrations. This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed by several factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source or target), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks if applicable. Further investigation is warranted to develop a comprehensive understanding of these factors in future research. et.al.|[2401.12097](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12097)|null|
|**2024-01-22**|**Revisiting Demonstration Selection Strategies in In-Context Learning**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model. However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent. We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.

|**2024-01-22**|**Temporal Blind Spots in Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing tasks. These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.

Two distinct reward model training strategies are employed for fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Notably, the improvements in performance achieved through this method are comparable to those of GPT Neo 2.7B parameter variant. Additionally, an auxiliary scoring mechanism is introduced, which demonstrates the limitations of conventional linguistic metrics in evaluating responses in the programming domain. Through accurate analysis, this paper looks at the divergence between traditional linguistic metrics and our human-preferences-based reward model, underscoring the imperative for domain-specific evaluation methods. By elucidating the complexities involved in applying RLHF to programming CQA and accentuating the significance of context-aware evaluation, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts in refining Large Language Models through focused human feedback. et.al.|[2401.10882](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10882)|null|
|**2024-01-19**|**Pruning for Protection: Increasing Jailbreak Resistance in Aligned LLMs Without Fine-Tuning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to `Jailbreaking' prompts, a type of attack that can coax these models into generating harmful and illegal content. In this paper, we show that pruning up to 20% of LLM parameters markedly increases their resistance to such attacks without additional training and without sacrificing their performance in standard benchmarks. Intriguingly, we discovered that the enhanced safety observed post-pruning correlates to the initial safety training level of the model, hinting that the effect of pruning could be more general and may hold for other LLM behaviors beyond safety. Additionally, we introduce a curated dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories, inserted into ten different Jailbreaking prompts, showing that pruning aids LLMs in concentrating attention on task-relevant tokens in jailbreaking prompts. Lastly, our experiments reveal that the prominent chat models, such as LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna, and Mistral Instruct exhibit high susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks, with some categories achieving nearly 70-100% success rate. These insights underline the potential of pruning as a generalizable approach for improving LLM safety, reliability, and potentially other desired behaviors. et.al.|[2401.10862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10862)|null|
|**2024-01-19**|**Using LLMs to discover emerging coded antisemitic hate-speech emergence in extremist social media**|Online hate speech proliferation has created a difficult problem for social media platforms. A particular challenge relates to the use of coded language by groups interested in both creating a sense of belonging for its users and evading detection. Coded language evolves quickly and its use varies over time. This paper proposes a methodology for detecting emerging coded hate-laden terminology. The methodology is tested in the context of online antisemitic discourse. The approach considers posts scraped from social media platforms, often used by extremist users. The posts are scraped using seed expressions related to previously known discourse of hatred towards Jews. The method begins by identifying the expressions most representative of each post and calculating their frequency in the whole corpus. It filters out grammatically incoherent expressions as well as previously encountered ones so as to focus on emergent well-formed terminology. This is followed by an assessment of semantic similarity to known antisemitic terminology using a fine-tuned large language model, and subsequent filtering out of the expressions that are too distant from known expressions of hatred. Emergent antisemitic expressions containing terms clearly relating to Jewish topics are then removed to return only coded expressions of hatred. et.al.|[2401.10841](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10841)|null|

Second, we focus on methods designed for datasets with scarce annotations. Third, we evaluate the performance of the main NER implementations on a variety of datasets with differing characteristics (as regards their domain, their size, and their number of classes).

|**2024-01-19**|**Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads**|The inference process in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often limited due to the absence of parallelism in the auto-regressive decoding process, resulting in most operations being restricted by the memory bandwidth of accelerators. While methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue, their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mechanism, Medusa constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them simultaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, Medusa introduces only minimal overhead in terms of single-step latency while substantially reducing the number of decoding steps required.   We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for Medusa to meet the needs of different use cases: Medusa-1: Medusa is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM, enabling lossless inference acceleration. Medusa-2: Medusa is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling better prediction accuracy of Medusa heads and higher speedup but needing a special training recipe that preserves the backbone model's capabilities.   Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa, including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while maintaining generation quality. We evaluate Medusa on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our experiments demonstrate that Medusa-1 can achieve over 2.2x speedup without compromising generation quality, while Medusa-2 further improves the speedup to 2.3-3.6x. et.al.|[2401.10774](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10774)|**[link](https://github.com/fasterdecoding/medusa)**|

In this paper, we demonstrate that reducing the inconsistency between the external knowledge encapsulated in the training data and the intrinsic knowledge inherited in the pretraining corpus could mitigate hallucination in alignment. Specifically, we introduce a novel knowledge consistent alignment (KCA) approach, which involves automatically formulating examinations based on external knowledge for accessing the comprehension of LLMs. For data encompassing knowledge inconsistency, KCA implements several simple yet efficient strategies for processing. We illustrate the superior performance of the proposed KCA approach in mitigating hallucinations across six benchmarks using LLMs of different backbones and scales. Furthermore, we confirm the correlation between knowledge inconsistency and hallucination, signifying the effectiveness of reducing knowledge inconsistency in alleviating hallucinations.

Our work examines user interactions, with a particular focus on query formulation strategies. In our study, 60 participants were assigned either traditional or LLM-based search engines as assistants for geolocation. Participants using traditional search more accurately predicted the location of the image compared to those using the LLM-based search. Distinct strategies emerged between users depending on the type of assistant. Participants using the LLM-based search issued longer, more natural language queries, but had shorter search sessions. When reformulating their search queries, traditional search participants tended to add more terms to their initial queries, whereas participants using the LLM-based search consistently rephrased their initial queries. et.al.|[2401.10184](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10184)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction**|Traffic prediction, a critical component for intelligent transportation systems, endeavors to foresee future traffic at specific locations using historical data. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not seen improvements accordingly. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pre-training while maintaining their fundamental structures. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. Specifically, ST-LLM redefines the timesteps at each location as tokens and incorporates a spatial-temporal embedding module to learn the spatial location and global temporal representations of tokens. Then these representations are fused to provide each token with unified spatial and temporal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel partially frozen attention strategy of the LLM, which is designed to capture spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios. et.al.|[2401.10134](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10134)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs**|Reasoning is a fundamental component for achieving language understanding. Among the multiple types of reasoning, conditional reasoning, the ability to draw different conclusions depending on some condition, has been understudied in large language models (LLMs). Recent prompting methods, such as chain of thought, have significantly improved LLMs on reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs. We hypothesize that code prompts can trigger conditional reasoning in LLMs trained on text and code. We propose a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and prompts the LLM with the generated code. Our experiments find that code prompts exhibit a performance boost between 2.6 and 7.7 points on GPT 3.5 across multiple datasets requiring conditional reasoning. We then conduct experiments to discover how code prompts elicit conditional reasoning abilities and through which features. We observe that prompts need to contain natural language text accompanied by high-quality code that closely represents the semantics of the instance text. Furthermore, we show that code prompts are more efficient, requiring fewer demonstrations, and that they trigger superior state tracking of variables or key entities. et.al.|[2401.10065](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10065)|**[link](https://github.com/ukplab/arxiv2024-conditional-reasoning-llms)**|

However, a major challenge persists in current text-to-image systems are often unable to handle diverse inputs, or are limited to single model results. Current unified attempts often fall into two orthogonal aspects: i) parse Diverse Prompts in input stage; ii) activate expert model to output. To combine the best of both worlds, we propose DiffusionGPT, which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to offer a unified generation system capable of seamlessly accommodating various types of prompts and integrating domain-expert models. DiffusionGPT constructs domain-specific Trees for various generative models based on prior knowledge. When provided with an input, the LLM parses the prompt and employs the Trees-of-Thought to guide the selection of an appropriate model, thereby relaxing input constraints and ensuring exceptional performance across diverse domains. Moreover, we introduce Advantage Databases, where the Tree-of-Thought is enriched with human feedback, aligning the model selection process with human preferences. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffusionGPT, showcasing its potential for pushing the boundaries of image synthesis in diverse domains. et.al.|[2401.10061](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10061)|null|

These representations provide users with a concise overview, aiding scientists in navigating the dense academic landscape. Our novel automated approach leverages the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce structured scholarly contribution summaries, offering both a practical solution and insights into LLMs' emergent abilities.   For LLMs, the prime focus is on improving their general intelligence as conversational agents. We argue that these models can also be applied effectively in information extraction (IE), specifically in complex IE tasks within terse domains like Science. This paradigm shift replaces the traditional modular, pipelined machine learning approach with a simpler objective expressed through instructions. Our results show that finetuned FLAN-T5 with 1000x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art GPT-davinci is competitive for the task. et.al.|[2401.10040](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10040)|null|

These analysts also depend on internal repositories, which act as private local knowledge database for an organization. Credible cyber intelligence, critical operational details, and relevant organizational information are all stored in these local knowledge databases. Analysts undertake a labor intensive task utilizing these global and local knowledge databases to manually create organization's unique threat response and mitigation strategies. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to efficiently process large diverse knowledge sources. We leverage this ability to process global and local knowledge databases to automate the generation of organization-specific threat intelligence.   In this work, we present LOCALINTEL, a novel automated knowledge contextualization system that, upon prompting, retrieves threat reports from the global threat repositories and uses its local knowledge database to contextualize them for a specific organization. LOCALINTEL comprises of three key phases: global threat intelligence retrieval, local knowledge retrieval, and contextualized completion generation. The former retrieves intelligence from global threat repositories, while the second retrieves pertinent knowledge from the local knowledge database. Finally, the fusion of these knowledge sources is orchestrated through a generator to produce a contextualized completion. et.al.|[2401.10036](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10036)|null|
|**2024-01-18**|**Evolutionary Computation in the Era of Large Language Model: Survey and Roadmap**|Large Language Models (LLMs), built upon Transformer-based architectures with massive pretraining on diverse data, have not only revolutionized natural language processing but also extended their prowess to various domains, marking a significant stride towards artificial general intelligence. The interplay between LLMs and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives and methodologies, reveals intriguing parallels, especially in their shared optimization nature, black-box characteristics, and proficiency in handling complex problems. Meanwhile, EA can not only provide an optimization framework for LLM's further enhancement under black-box settings but also empower LLM with flexible global search and iterative mechanism in applications. On the other hand, LLM's abundant domain knowledge enables EA to perform smarter searches, while its text processing capability assist in deploying EA across various tasks. Based on their complementary advantages, this paper presents a comprehensive review and forward-looking roadmap, categorizing their mutual inspiration into LLM-enhanced evolutionary optimization and EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the amalgamation of LLMs and EAs in various application scenarios, including neural architecture search, code generation, software engineering, and text generation. As the first comprehensive review specifically focused on the EA research in the era of LLMs, this paper provides a foundational stepping stone for understanding and harnessing the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. By presenting a comprehensive review, categorization, and critical analysis, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on the cross-disciplinary study of these two powerful paradigms.

Different from short videos with a few seconds, vlog often contains a complex storyline with diversified scenes, which is challenging for most existing video generation approaches. To break through this bottleneck, our Vlogger smartly leverages Large Language Model (LLM) as Director and decomposes a long video generation task of vlog into four key stages, where we invoke various foundation models to play the critical roles of vlog professionals, including (1) Script, (2) Actor, (3) ShowMaker, and (4) Voicer. With such a design of mimicking human beings, our Vlogger can generate vlogs through explainable cooperation of top-down planning and bottom-up shooting. Moreover, we introduce a novel video diffusion model, ShowMaker, which serves as a videographer in our Vlogger for generating the video snippet of each shooting scene. By incorporating Script and Actor attentively as textual and visual prompts, it can effectively enhance spatial-temporal coherence in the snippet. Besides, we design a concise mixed training paradigm for ShowMaker, boosting its capacity for both T2V generation and prediction. Finally, the extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot T2V generation and prediction tasks. More importantly, Vlogger can generate over 5-minute vlogs from open-world descriptions, without loss of video coherence on script and actor.

|**2024-01-17**|**Deciphering Textual Authenticity: A Generalized Strategy through the Lens of Large Language Semantics for Detecting Human vs. Machine-Generated Text**|With the recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been an increasing demand for tools to detect machine-generated text. The effective detection of machine-generated text face two pertinent problems: First, they are severely limited in generalizing against real-world scenarios, where machine-generated text is produced by a variety of generators, including but not limited to GPT-4 and Dolly, and spans diverse domains, ranging from academic manuscripts to social media posts. Second, existing detection methodologies treat texts produced by LLMs through a restrictive binary classification lens, neglecting the nuanced diversity of artifacts generated by different LLMs. In this work, we undertake a systematic study on the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. We first study the effectiveness of state-of-the-art approaches and find that they are severely limited against text produced by diverse generators and domains in the real world. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations of the embeddings from a pretrained LLM's encoder show that they cannot reliably distinguish between human and machine-generated text. Based on our findings, we introduce a novel system, T5LLMCipher, for detecting machine-generated text using a pretrained T5 encoder combined with LLM embedding sub-clustering to address the text produced by diverse generators and domains in the real world. We evaluate our approach across 9 machine-generated text systems and 9 domains and find that our approach provides state-of-the-art generalization ability, with an average increase in F1 score on machine-generated text of 19.6\% on unseen generators and domains compared to the top performing existing approaches and correctly attributes the generator of text with an accuracy of 93.6\%. et.al.|[2401.09407](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09407)|null|

However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question. In response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks. These controlled perturbations span across multiple fine dimensions of the structural and representational aspects of maths questions. Using GPT-4, we generated the MORE dataset by perturbing randomly selected five seed questions from GSM8K. This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems. We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE. The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions. This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities. This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development. Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE. et.al.|[2401.09395](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09395)|null|
|**2024-01-17**|**Large Language Models Are Neurosymbolic Reasoners**|A wide range of real-world applications is characterized by their symbolic nature, necessitating a strong capability for symbolic reasoning. This paper investigates the potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as symbolic reasoners. We focus on text-based games, significant benchmarks for agents with natural language capabilities, particularly in symbolic tasks like math, map reading, sorting, and applying common sense in text-based worlds. To facilitate these agents, we propose an LLM agent designed to tackle symbolic challenges and achieve in-game objectives. We begin by initializing the LLM agent and informing it of its role. The agent then receives observations and a set of valid actions from the text-based games, along with a specific symbolic module. With these inputs, the LLM agent chooses an action and interacts with the game environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the capability of LLMs as automated agents for symbolic reasoning, and our LLM agent is effective in text-based games involving symbolic tasks, achieving an average performance of 88% across all tasks. et.al.|[2401.09334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09334)|null|

Such task has remained formidable, with solutions often involving ad-hoc scalar and vectorial sets of materials properties, making optimization and transferability challenging. We extract representations directly from ab-initio differential electron charge density profiles using Neural Networks, highlighting the pivotal role of transfer learning in such task. Firstly, we demonstrate significant improvements in regression of a specific defected-materials property with respect to training a deep network from scratch, both in terms of predictions and their reproducibilities, by considering various pre-trained models and selecting the optimal one after fine-tuning. The remarkable performances obtained confirmed the transferability of the existent pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on physics domain data, very different from the original training data. Secondly, we demonstrate a saturation in the regression capabilities of computer vision models towards properties of an extensive variety of undefected systems, and how it can be overcome with the help of large language model (LLM) transformers, with as little text information as composition names. Finally, we prove the insufficiency of open-models, like GPT-4, in achieving the analogous tasks and performances as the proposed domain-specific ones. The work offers a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of descriptor identification in complex physical systems, shedding light over the power of transfer learning to easily adapt and combine available models, with different modalities, to the physics domain, at the same time opening space to a benchmark for LLMs capabilities in such domain. et.al.|[2401.09301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09301)|null|
|**2024-01-17**|**Beyond Anti-Forgetting: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with Positive Forward Transfer**|Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to meet continuously emerging requirements without expensive retraining. MCIT faces two major obstacles: catastrophic forgetting (where old knowledge is forgotten) and negative forward transfer (where the performance of future tasks is degraded). Although existing methods have greatly alleviated catastrophic forgetting, they still suffer from negative forward transfer. By performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on input embeddings, we discover a large discrepancy in different input embeddings. The discrepancy results in the model learning irrelevant information for old and pre-trained tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer. To address these issues, we propose Fwd-Prompt, a prompt-based method projecting prompt gradient to the residual space to minimize the interference between tasks and to the pre-trained subspace for reusing pre-trained knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that Fwd-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance while updating fewer parameters and requiring no old samples. Our research sheds light on the potential of continuously adapting MLLMs to new tasks under the instruction tuning paradigm and encourages future studies to explore MCIT. The code will soon be publicly available. et.al.|[2401.09181](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09181)|null|

Buff decouples all of the sharding dimensions into a new hierarchical space, and systematically analyzes the memory and communication cost of LLM training. Then, it generates an effective hybrid parallelism strategy. We design a new selective overlap mechanism to mitigate the communication overhead introduced by the hybrid parallelism. We also implement memory management techniques to reduce GPU memory fragmentation. Evaluation results show that Buff generates parallelization strategies that match or outperform existing methods in model FLOPs utilization. et.al.|[2401.09149](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09149)|null|

However, how the public uses them for healthcare purposes such as medical Q\&A, self-diagnosis, and daily healthcare information seeking is under-investigated. In this paper, we adopt a mixed-methods approach, including surveys (N=167) and interviews (N=17) to investigate how and why the public uses LLMs for healthcare. LLMs as a healthcare tool have gained popularity, and are often used in combination with other information channels such as search engines and online health communities to optimize information quality. LLMs provide more accurate information and a more convenient interaction/service model compared to traditional channels. LLMs also do a better job of reducing misinformation, especially in daily healthcare questions. Doctors using LLMs for diagnosis is less acceptable than for auxiliary work such as writing medical records.

Although LLMs have shown great capacity to perform human-like task accomplishment in natural language and natural image, their potential in handling remote sensing interpretation tasks has not yet been fully explored. Moreover, the lack of automation in remote sensing task planning hinders the accessibility of remote sensing interpretation techniques, especially to non-remote sensing experts from multiple research fields. To this end, we present Remote Sensing ChatGPT, an LLM-powered agent that utilizes ChatGPT to connect various AI-based remote sensing models to solve complicated interpretation tasks. More specifically, given a user request and a remote sensing image, we utilized ChatGPT to understand user requests, perform task planning according to the tasks' functions, execute each subtask iteratively, and generate the final response according to the output of each subtask. Considering that LLM is trained with natural language and is not capable of directly perceiving visual concepts as contained in remote sensing images, we designed visual cues that inject visual information into ChatGPT. With Remote Sensing ChatGPT, users can simply send a remote sensing image with the corresponding request, and get the interpretation results as well as language feedback from Remote Sensing ChatGPT. Experiments and examples show that Remote Sensing ChatGPT can tackle a wide range of remote sensing tasks and can be extended to more tasks with more sophisticated models such as the remote sensing foundation model.

To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian. We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks. Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations. These models also excel in processing and applying prompts. However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.   Furthermore, we identified errors and limitations inherent in popular LLMs as machine translation tools and categorized them based on various linguistic metrics. This typology of errors provides valuable insights for utilizing LLMs effectively and offers methods for designing prompts for in-context learning.

Finally, we let the experts evaluate the safety of the generated text. We release HAI-coaching, the first expert-annotated nutrition counselling dataset containing ~2.4K dietary struggles from crowd workers, and ~97K related supportive texts generated by ChatGPT.

|**2024-01-16**|**Contrastive Preference Optimization: Pushing the Boundaries of LLM Performance in Machine Translation**|Moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) -- those with 7B or 13B parameters -- exhibit promising machine translation (MT) performance. However, even the top-performing 13B LLM-based translation models, like ALMA, does not match the performance of state-of-the-art conventional encoder-decoder translation models or larger-scale LLMs such as GPT-4. In this study, we bridge this performance gap. We first assess the shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning for LLMs in the MT task, emphasizing the quality issues present in the reference data, despite being human-generated. Then, in contrast to SFT which mimics reference translations, we introduce Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), a novel approach that trains models to avoid generating adequate but not perfect translations. Applying CPO to ALMA models with only 22K parallel sentences and 12M parameters yields significant improvements.

RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains. et.al.|[2401.08406](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**DoraemonGPT: Toward Understanding Dynamic Scenes with Large Language Models**|The field of AI agents is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving tasks for the image modality, which limits their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world, making it still far from real-life applications, e.g., guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing and perceptually intensive nature of real-world scenarios, we devise DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to handle dynamic video tasks. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video with massive content into a symbolic memory that stores \textit{task-related} attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by sub-task tools, resulting in concise and relevant intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, we introduce a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT in dynamic scenes and provide in-the-wild showcases demonstrating its ability to handle more complex questions than previous studies. et.al.|[2401.08392](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08392)|**[link](https://github.com/z-x-yang/doraemongpt)**|
|**2024-01-16**|**Exploiting Inter-Layer Expert Affinity for Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Model Inference**|In large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the Mixture of Experts paradigm has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing model expressiveness and accuracy. However, deploying GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput. We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training. et.al.|[2401.08383](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08383)|null|

Hallucination refers to the fact that in addition to correct responses, LLMs can also generate seemingly correct but factually incorrect responses. This report aims to present a comprehensive review of the current literature on both hallucination detection and hallucination mitigation. We hope that this report can serve as a good reference for both engineers and researchers who are interested in LLMs and applying them to real world tasks. et.al.|[2401.08358](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08358)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**Salute the Classic: Revisiting Challenges of Machine Translation in the Age of Large Language Models**|The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field. This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search. Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase. Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words. However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist. While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation. The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT. et.al.|[2401.08350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08350)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**Understanding User Experience in Large Language Model Interactions**|In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), most research has primarily viewed them as independent individuals, focusing on assessing their capabilities through standardized benchmarks and enhancing their general intelligence. This perspective, however, tends to overlook the vital role of LLMs as user-centric services in human-AI collaboration. This gap in research becomes increasingly critical as LLMs become more integrated into people's everyday and professional interactions. This study addresses the important need to understand user satisfaction with LLMs by exploring four key aspects: comprehending user intents, scrutinizing user experiences, addressing major user concerns about current LLM services, and charting future research paths to bolster human-AI collaborations. Our study develops a taxonomy of 7 user intents in LLM interactions, grounded in analysis of real-world user interaction logs and human verification. Subsequently, we conduct a user survey to gauge their satisfaction with LLM services, encompassing usage frequency, experiences across intents, and predominant concerns. This survey, compiling 411 anonymous responses, uncovers 11 first-hand insights into the current state of user engagement with LLMs. Based on this empirical analysis, we pinpoint 6 future research directions prioritizing the user perspective in LLM developments. This user-centered approach is essential for crafting LLMs that are not just technologically advanced but also resonate with the intricate realities of human interactions and real-world applications. et.al.|[2401.08329](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08329)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**RoTBench: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models in Tool Learning**|Tool learning has generated widespread interest as a vital means of interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical world. Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs' capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoTBench, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy. More surprisingly, the noise correction capability inherent in the GPT family paradoxically impedes its adaptability in the face of mild noise. In light of these findings, we propose RoTTuning, a strategy that enriches the diversity of training environments to bolster the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/RoTBench. et.al.|[2401.08326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08326)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**Application of LLM Agents in Recruitment: A Novel Framework for Resume Screening**|The automation of resume screening is a crucial aspect of the recruitment process in organizations. Automated resume screening systems often encompass a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the efficacy of these systems, showcasing their robust generalization abilities across diverse language-related tasks. Accompanying these developments are various agents based on LLMs, which facilitate their application in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes. Our framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each resume from a large dataset. Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for decision-making, determining which candidates receive job offers, or which ones to bring in for interviews. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from actual resumes and conducted simulate a resume screening process. Subsequently, the outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed analysis. The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching 87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase. In the resume summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline performance of the GPT-3.5 model. Analysis of the decision-making efficacy of the LLM agents in the final offer stage further underscores the potential of LLM agents in transforming resume screening processes. et.al.|[2401.08315](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08315)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**Anchor function: a type of benchmark functions for studying language models**|Understanding transformer-based language models is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly as they play pivotal roles in advancing towards artificial general intelligence. However, language model research faces significant challenges, especially for academic research groups with constrained resources. These challenges include complex data structures, unknown target functions, high computational costs and memory requirements, and a lack of interpretability in the inference process, etc. Drawing a parallel to the use of simple models in scientific research, we propose the concept of an anchor function. This is a type of benchmark function designed for studying language models in learning tasks that follow an "anchor-key" pattern. By utilizing the concept of an anchor function, we can construct a series of functions to simulate various language tasks. The anchor function plays a role analogous to that of mice in diabetes research, particularly suitable for academic research. We demonstrate the utility of the anchor function with an example, revealing two basic operations by attention structures in language models: shifting tokens and broadcasting one token from one position to many positions. These operations are also commonly observed in large language models. The anchor function framework, therefore, opens up a series of valuable and accessible research questions for further exploration, especially for theoretical study. et.al.|[2401.08309](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08309)|null|
|**2024-01-16**|**DAPT: A Dual Attention Framework for Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning of Large Language Models**|The continual learning (CL) ability is vital for deploying large language models (LLMs) in the dynamic world. Based on parameter-efficient tuning (PET), existing methods devise the learning module and the selection module to handle the challenges of catastrophic forgetting (CF) and knowledge transfer (KT) in CL. The learning module allocates separate PET blocks for each continually emerged task and the selection module function to choose the correct one for the input at testing time. However, there are limitations in their deigns of both modules and they ignore the potential of aligning the two module to address CF and KT simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Dual Attention Framework , to align the PET learning and selection via the Dual Attentive Learning\&Selection module. Extensive Experiments on two CL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DAPT to resist CF and facilitate KT at the same time. Moreover, DAPT exhibits the superiority when we scale it to different model sizes (from 770M to 11B) and unseen tasks. et.al.|[2401.08295](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08295)|null|

Compared with most existing inference engines, Inferflow has some key features. First, by implementing a modular framework of atomic build-blocks and technologies, Inferflow is compositionally generalizable to new models. Second, 3.5-bit quantization is introduced in Inferflow as a tradeoff between 3-bit and 4-bit quantization.

However, their performances on image aesthetics perception remain indeterminate, which is highly desired in real-world applications. An obvious obstacle lies in the absence of a specific benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs on aesthetic perception. This blind groping may impede the further development of more advanced MLLMs with aesthetic perception capacity. To address this dilemma, we propose AesBench, an expert benchmark aiming to comprehensively evaluate the aesthetic perception capacities of MLLMs through elaborate design across dual facets. (1) We construct an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD), which features diversified image contents and high-quality annotations provided by professional aesthetic experts. (2) We propose a set of integrative criteria to measure the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs from four perspectives, including Perception (AesP), Empathy (AesE), Assessment (AesA) and Interpretation (AesI). Extensive experimental results underscore that the current MLLMs only possess rudimentary aesthetic perception ability, and there is still a significant gap between MLLMs and humans. We hope this work can inspire the community to engage in deeper explorations on the aesthetic potentials of MLLMs. Source data will be available at https://github.com/yipoh/AesBench. et.al.|[2401.08276](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08276)|**[link](https://github.com/yipoh/aesbench)**|
|**2024-01-16**|**Large Language Models are Null-Shot Learners**|This paper presents null-shot prompting. Null-shot prompting exploits hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize information from the "Examples" section that never exists within the provided context to perform a task. While reducing hallucination is crucial and non-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the current landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in fact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting. Experiments with six LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering. The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model. These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets. We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results. et.al.|[2401.08273](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08273)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements**|Large language models demonstrate a remarkable capability for learning to solve new tasks from a few examples. The prompt template, or the way the input examples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet often overlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of the template format's influence on the in-context learning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template across models (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. We show that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of the strongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. More importantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups and even between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currently prevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may give misleading results due to different templates in different works. As a first step towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles that aggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-time augmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice of random set of templates. et.al.|[2401.06766](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06766)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**APAR: LLMs Can Do Auto-Parallel Auto-Regressive Decoding**|The massive adoption of large language models (LLMs) demands efficient deployment strategies. However, the auto-regressive decoding process, which is fundamental to how most LLMs generate text, poses challenges to achieve efficient serving. In this work, we introduce a parallel auto-regressive generation method. By instruct-tuning on general domain data that contains hierarchical structures, we enable LLMs to independently plan their generation process and perform auto-parallel auto-regressive (APAR) generation, significantly reducing the number of generation steps. APAR alone can achieve up to 2x speed-up, and when combined with speculative decoding, the speed-up can reach up to 4x. In addition, APAR reduces the key-value cache consumption and attention computation during generation. This leads to a throughput increase of 20-70% and a latency reduce of 20-35% in high-throughput scenarios, compared to state-of-the-art serving frameworks. et.al.|[2401.06761](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06761)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**Few-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text using Style Representations**|The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human writing poses a significant risk of abuse. For example, such models could be used for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse may be counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to this problem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed human and machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further language models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the detectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that may have generated a document in question at inference or detection time, which is often impractical. In light of these challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including state of the art large language models like Llama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which model generated a given document. et.al.|[2401.06712](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06712)|null|
|**2024-01-12**|**Multi-Candidate Speculative Decoding**|Large language models have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of NLP tasks, yet their generating text autoregressively is time-consuming. One way to speed them up is speculative decoding, which generates candidate segments (a sequence of tokens) from a fast draft model that is then verified in parallel by the target model. However, the acceptance rate of candidate tokens receives limitations from several factors, such as the model, the dataset, and the decoding setup. This paper proposes sampling multiple candidates from a draft model and then organising them in batches for verification. We design algorithms for efficient multi-candidate verification while maintaining the distribution of the target model. Our approach shows significant improvements in acceptance rates on multiple datasets and models, consistently outperforming standard speculative decoding. et.al.|[2401.06706](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06706)|**[link](https://github.com/njunlp/mcsd)**|
|**2024-01-12**|**An Experimental Design Framework for Label-Efficient Supervised Finetuning of Large Language Models**|Supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction datasets has played a crucial role in achieving the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities observed in modern large language models (LLMs). However, the annotation efforts required to produce high quality responses for instructions are becoming prohibitively expensive, especially as the number of tasks spanned by instruction datasets continues to increase. Active learning is effective in identifying useful subsets of samples to annotate from an unlabeled pool, but its high computational cost remains a barrier to its widespread applicability in the context of LLMs. To mitigate the annotation cost of SFT and circumvent the computational bottlenecks of active learning, we propose using experimental design. Experimental design techniques select the most informative samples to label, and typically maximize some notion of uncertainty and/or diversity. In our work, we implement a framework that evaluates several existing and novel experimental design techniques and find that these methods consistently yield significant gains in label efficiency with little computational overhead. On generative tasks, our methods achieve the same generalization performance with only $50\%$ of annotation cost required by random sampling. et.al.|[2401.06692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06692)|null|

Combining Machine Translation Hypotheses Using Quality Estimation**|Neural machine translation systems estimate probabilities of target sentences given source sentences, yet these estimates may not align with human preferences. This work introduces QE-fusion, a method utilizing a quality estimation metric (QE) that better correlates with human judgments to synthesize improved translations. QE-fusion leverages a candidate pool sampled from a model, combining spans from different candidates using QE metrics such as CometKiwi. We compare QE-fusion against beam search and recent reranking techniques, such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding or QE-reranking. Our method consistently improves translation quality in terms of COMET and BLEURT scores when applied to large language models (LLMs) used for translation (PolyLM, XGLM, Llama2, and Mistral) and to multilingual translation models (NLLB), over five language pairs. Notably, QE-fusion exhibits larger improvements for LLMs due to their ability to generate diverse outputs. We demonstrate that our approach generates novel translations in over half of the cases and consistently outperforms other methods across varying numbers of candidates (5-200). Furthermore, we empirically establish that QE-fusion scales linearly with the number of candidates in the pool. QE-fusion proves effective in enhancing LLM-based translation without the need for costly retraining of LLMs. et.al.|[2401.06688](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06688)|null|

Nevertheless, depending on the methodology or the dataset, these systems typically fail to capture user preferences and generate general recommendations. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) offer promising results for analyzing user queries. However, employing these models to capture user preferences and efficiency remains an open question. In this paper, we propose LLMRS, an LLM-based zero-shot recommender system where we employ pre-trained LLM to encode user reviews into a review score and generate user-tailored recommendations. We experimented with LLMRS on a real-world dataset, the Amazon product reviews, for software purchase use cases.

However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts' lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs and 6 datasets. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, while downstream model performance is highest when previously created paraphrases are used as hints. et.al.|[2401.06643](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06643)|**[link](https://github.com/kinit-sk/llm-div-incts)**|

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective to jailbreak LLMs as human-like communicators, to explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate interpretable persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP and, found a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs et.al.|[2401.06373](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06373)|null|

Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place. To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning. We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning. We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy. Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of "extreme" LLM compression--defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter, from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our work builds on top of Additive Quantization, a classic algorithm from the MCQ family, and adapts it to the quantization of language models. The resulting algorithm advances the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, outperforming all recently-proposed techniques in terms of accuracy at a given compression budget. For instance, when compressing Llama 2 models to 2 bits per parameter, our algorithm quantizes the 7B model to 6.93 perplexity (a 1.29 improvement relative to the best prior work, and 1.81 points from FP16), the 13B model to 5.70 perplexity (a .36 improvement) and the 70B model to 3.94 perplexity (a .22 improvement) on WikiText2.

Given the capabilities of LLMs in generating human-understandable text, we propose leveraging the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. We introduce a framework called Patchscopes and show how it can be used to answer a wide range of research questions about an LLM's computation. We show that prior interpretability methods based on projecting representations into the vocabulary space and intervening on the LLM computation, can be viewed as special instances of this framework. Moreover, several of their shortcomings such as failure in inspecting early layers or lack of expressivity can be mitigated by a Patchscope. Beyond unifying prior inspection techniques, Patchscopes also opens up new possibilities such as using a more capable model to explain the representations of a smaller model, and unlocks new applications such as self-correction in multi-hop reasoning. et.al.|[2401.06102](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06102)|null|
|**2024-01-11**|**A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance**|In machine learning (ML), a widespread adage is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for binary classification tasks with class imbalance. This paper challenges this notion through novel mathematical analysis, illustrating that AUROC and AUPRC can be concisely related in probabilistic terms. We demonstrate that AUPRC, contrary to popular belief, is not superior in cases of class imbalance and might even be a harmful metric, given its inclination to unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels. This bias can inadvertently heighten algorithmic disparities. Prompted by these insights, a thorough review of existing ML literature was conducted, utilizing large language models to analyze over 1.5 million papers from arXiv. Our investigation focused on the prevalence and substantiation of the purported AUPRC superiority. The results expose a significant deficit in empirical backing and a trend of misattributions that have fuelled the widespread acceptance of AUPRC's supposed advantages. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding metric behaviors and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.

It provides critical information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care. However, documenting CCs can be time-consuming for healthcare providers, especially in busy emergency departments. To address this issue, an autocompletion tool that suggests accurate and well-formatted phrases or sentences for clinical notes can be a valuable resource for triage nurses. In this study, we utilized text generation techniques to develop machine learning models using CC data. In our proposed work, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and fine-tune three different variants of Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT), namely microsoft/biogpt, microsoft/BioGPT-Large, and microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA. Additionally, we tune a prompt by incorporating exemplar CC sentences, utilizing the OpenAI API of GPT-4. We evaluate the models' performance based on the perplexity score, modified BERTScore, and cosine similarity score. The results show that BioGPT-Large exhibits superior performance compared to the other models. It consistently achieves a remarkably low perplexity score of 1.65 when generating CC, whereas the baseline LSTM model achieves the best perplexity score of 170. Further, we evaluate and assess the proposed models' performance and the outcome of GPT-4.0.

However, existing RL methods mostly adopt the instance-level reward, which is unable to provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks, and can not focus on the few key tokens that lead to the incorrectness. To address it, we propose a new RL method named \textbf{RLMEC} that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, and can produce token-level rewards for RL training. Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process. And the both objectives focus on the learning of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens. The experiment results on mathematical tasks and question-answering tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

|**2024-01-11**|**Secrets of RLHF in Large Language Models Part II: Reward Modeling**|Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a crucial technology for aligning language models with human values and intentions, enabling models to produce more helpful and harmless responses. Reward models are trained as proxies for human preferences to drive reinforcement learning optimization. While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance, they face the following challenges in practical applications: (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training.   In this report, we attempt to address these two issues. (1) From a data perspective, we propose a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data, based on a voting mechanism of multiple reward models. Experimental results confirm that data with varying preference strengths have different impacts on reward model performance. We introduce a series of novel methods to mitigate the influence of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset and fully leverage high-quality preference data. (2) From an algorithmic standpoint, we introduce contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, thereby improving model generalization. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to enable the reward model to maintain the ability to differentiate subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples, and this approach can be utilized for iterative RLHF optimization. et.al.|[2401.06080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080)|**[link](https://github.com/openlmlab/moss-rlhf)**|
|**2024-01-11**|**LEGO:Language Enhanced Multi-modal Grounding Model**|Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks in different modalities. However, existing multi-modal models primarily emphasize capturing global information within each modality while neglecting the importance of perceiving local information across modalities. Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding. To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose LEGO, a language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. Beyond capturing global information like other multi-modal models, our proposed model excels at tasks demanding a detailed understanding of local information within the input. It demonstrates precise identification and localization of specific regions in images or moments in videos. To achieve this objective, we design a diversified dataset construction pipeline, resulting in a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset for model training. The code, dataset, and demo of our model can be found at https: //github.com/lzw-lzw/LEGO. et.al.|[2401.06071](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06071)|**[link](https://github.com/lzw-lzw/lego)**|
|**2024-01-11**|**DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models**|In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top- $K$ out of $N$ experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$ ones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations. et.al.|[2401.06066](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066)|**[link](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-moe)**|
|**2024-01-11**|**LLM-as-a-Coauthor: The Challenges of Detecting LLM-Human Mixcase**|With the remarkable development and widespread applications of large language models (LLMs), the use of machine-generated text (MGT) is becoming increasingly common. This trend brings potential risks, particularly to the quality and completeness of information in fields such as news and education. Current research predominantly addresses the detection of pure MGT without adequately addressing mixed scenarios including AI-revised Human-Written Text (HWT) or human-revised MGT. To confront this challenge, we introduce mixcase, a novel concept representing a hybrid text form involving both machine-generated and human-generated content. We collected mixcase instances generated from multiple daily text-editing scenarios and composed MixSet, the first dataset dedicated to studying these mixed modification scenarios. We conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of popular MGT detectors, assessing their effectiveness, robustness, and generalization performance. Our findings reveal that existing detectors struggle to identify mixcase as a separate class or MGT, particularly in dealing with subtle modifications and style adaptability. This research underscores the urgent need for more fine-grain detectors tailored for mixcase, offering valuable insights for future research.

To address this issue, we propose an in-context learning approach that guides LLMs to debug by using a "print debugging" method, which involves inserting print statements to trace and analysing logs for fixing the bug. We collect a Leetcode problem dataset and evaluate our method using the Leetcode online judging system. Experiments with GPT-4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming rubber duck debugging in easy and medium-level Leetcode problems by 1.5% and 17.9%. et.al.|[2401.05319](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05319)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**Theory of Mind abilities of Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction : An Illusion?**|Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks. However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?". We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack. et.al.|[2401.05302](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05302)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models**|Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference ("This paper has six sections.") are prevalent in many domains. Can large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present "I am a Strange Dataset", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is" (where a correct continuation is "is"). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence." (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range.

The system automates various stages of case analysis, including basic information extraction, admissibility examination, Periculum in mora and Fumus boni iuris analyses, and recommendations generation. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate INACIA's potential in extracting relevant information from case documents, evaluating its legal plausibility, and generating judicial recommendations. Utilizing a validation dataset alongside LLMs, our evaluation methodology presents an innovative approach to assessing system performance, correlating highly with human judgment. The results highlight INACIA's proficiency in handling complex legal tasks, indicating its suitability for augmenting efficiency and judicial fairness within legal systems. The paper also discusses potential enhancements and future applications, positioning INACIA as a model for worldwide AI integration in legal domains. et.al.|[2401.05273](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05273)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**CASA: Causality-driven Argument Sufficiency Assessment**|The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion. To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans. However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria. Motivated by the probability of sufficiency (PS) definition in the causal literature, we propose CASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework. PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion, when both the premise and conclusion events are absent. To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion, and revise them by injecting the premise event. Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments. We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.

In this paper, we focus on the classification of financial news title, which is a challenging task due to a lack of large amount of training samples. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to adapt the pretrained large language models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3] to solve this problem. The LLMs, which are trained from huge amount of text corpora,have an advantage in text understanding and can be effectively adapted to domain-specific task while requiring very few amount of training samples. In particular, we adapt the open-source Llama2-7B model (2023) with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) technique [4]. Experimental evaluation shows that even with the 7B model (which is relatively small for LLMs), our approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms. et.al.|[2401.05215](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05215)|**[link](https://github.com/luosting/LLaMA-Financial-sentiment-analysis)**|

In manufacturing, operating factories has become increasing knowledge-intensive putting strain on the factory's capacity to train and support new operators. In this paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to use the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation. The system aims to efficiently answer queries from operators and facilitate the sharing of new knowledge. To assess its effectiveness, we conducted an evaluation in a factory setting. The results of this evaluation demonstrated the system's benefits; namely, in enabling quicker information retrieval and more efficient resolution of issues. However, the study also highlighted a preference for learning from a human expert when such an option is available. Furthermore, we benchmarked several closed and open-sourced LLMs for this system. GPT-4 consistently outperformed its counterparts, with open-source models like StableBeluga2 trailing closely, presenting an attractive option given its data privacy and customization benefits. Overall, this work offers preliminary insights for factories considering using LLM-tools for knowledge management. et.al.|[2401.05200](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05200)|null|

Given the recent success of large language models (LLMs), they have the potential to create new recipes that can meet individual preferences, dietary constraints, and adapt to what is in your refrigerator. Existing research on using LLMs to generate recipes has shown that LLMs can be finetuned to generate realistic-sounding recipes. However, on close examination, these generated recipes often fail to meet basic requirements like including chicken as an ingredient in chicken dishes. In this paper, we propose RecipeMC, a text generation method using GPT-2 that relies on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). RecipeMC allows us to define reward functions to put soft constraints on text generation and thus improve the credibility of the generated recipes. Our results show that human evaluators prefer recipes generated with RecipeMC more often than recipes generated with other baseline methods when compared with real recipes. et.al.|[2401.05199](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05199)|null|
|**2024-01-10**|**Divide and Conquer for Large Language Models Reasoning**|Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various reasoning benchmarks with the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its derivative methods, particularly in tasks involving multi-choice questions (MCQs). However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning. First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ( $\mathcal{CS}$ ), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants. Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities across nine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks. For instance, compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsets of 8.72\% for AQuA, 15.07\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\% for RiddleSense. In addition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number of options, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models from referring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevant choices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.

A Comparative Study**|Inspired by the increasing interest in leveraging large language models for translation, this paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT in comparison to the mainstream neural machine translation (NMT) engines in translating Chinese diplomatic texts into English. Specifically, we examine the translation quality of ChatGPT and NMT engines as measured by four automated metrics and human evaluation based on an error-typology and six analytic rubrics. Our findings show that automated metrics yield similar results for ChatGPT under different prompts and NMT systems, while human annotators tend to assign noticeably higher scores to ChatGPT when it is provided an example or contextual information about the translation task. Pairwise correlation between automated metrics and dimensions of human evaluation produces weak and non-significant results, suggesting the divergence between the two methods of translation quality assessment. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT as a capable machine translator, and the influence of prompt engineering on its performance. et.al.|[2401.05176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05176)|null|
|**2024-01-09**|**Model Editing Can Hurt General Abilities of Large Language Models**|Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new paradigms for accessing the knowledge stored in their parameters. One critical challenge that has emerged is the presence of hallucinations in LLM outputs due to false or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs with updated information is resource-intensive, there has been a growing interest in model editing. However, many model editing methods, while effective in various scenarios, tend to overemphasize aspects such as efficacy, generalization, and locality in editing performance, often overlooking potential side effects on the general abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we raise concerns that the improvement of model factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of these general abilities, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of LLMs. Systematically, we analyze side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on two LLMs across eight representative task categories. Extensive empirical research reveals that model editing does improve model factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities. Therefore, we advocate for more research efforts to minimize the loss of general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training and to ultimately preserve them during model editing. et.al.|[2401.04700](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04700)|**[link](https://github.com/jasonforjoy/model-editing-hurt)**|
|**2024-01-09**|**Narrowing the Knowledge Evaluation Gap: Open-Domain Question Answering with Multi-Granularity Answers**|Factual questions typically can be answered correctly at different levels of granularity. For example, both ``August 4, 1961'' and ``1961'' are correct answers to the question ``When was Barack Obama born?''. Standard question answering (QA) evaluation protocols, however, do not explicitly take this into account and compare a predicted answer against answers of a single granularity level. In this work, we propose GRANOLA QA, a novel evaluation setting where a predicted answer is evaluated in terms of accuracy and informativeness against a set of multi-granularity answers. We present a simple methodology for enriching existing datasets with multi-granularity answers, and create GRANOLA-EQ, a multi-granularity version of the EntityQuestions dataset. We evaluate a range of decoding methods on GRANOLA-EQ, including a new algorithm, called Decoding with Response Aggregation (DRAG), that is geared towards aligning the response granularity with the model's uncertainty. Our experiments show that large language models with standard decoding tend to generate specific answers, which are often incorrect. In contrast, when evaluated on multi-granularity answers, DRAG yields a nearly 20 point increase in accuracy on average, which further increases for rare entities. Overall, this reveals that standard evaluation and decoding schemes may significantly underestimate the knowledge encapsulated in LMs. et.al.|[2401.04695](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04695)|null|

|**2024-01-09**|**Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models**|Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

However, the manual classification of issue reports for prioritization is laborious and lacks scalability. Alternatively, many open source software (OSS) projects employ automated processes for this task, albeit relying on substantial datasets for adequate training. This research seeks to devise an automated approach that ensures reliability in issue prioritization, even when trained on smaller datasets. Our proposed methodology harnesses the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), recognizing their potential to efficiently handle this task. By leveraging the capabilities of such models, we aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing issue reports accurately, mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while maintaining reliability. In our research, we have developed a reliable GPT-based approach to accurately label and prioritize issue reports with a reduced training dataset. By reducing reliance on massive data requirements and focusing on few-shot fine-tuning, our methodology offers a more accessible and efficient solution for issue prioritization in software engineering.

|**2024-01-09**|**DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability. However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging. et.al.|[2401.04621](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04621)|**[link](https://github.com/thunlp/debugbench)**|
|**2024-01-09**|**Agent Alignment in Evolving Social Norms**|Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly permeating various domains of human production and life, highlighting the importance of aligning them with human values. The current alignment of AI systems primarily focuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agents possess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback and self-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, we propose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, named EvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolution and selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environment where social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the current social norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation, while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental results assessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social norms demonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent possesses the capability to align progressively better with the evolving social norms while maintaining its proficiency in general tasks. Effectiveness tests conducted on various open and closed-source LLMs as the foundation for agents also prove the applicability of our approach. et.al.|[2401.04620](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04620)|null|

|**2024-01-09**|**The Critique of Critique**|Critique, as a natural language description for assessing the quality of model-generated content, has been proven to play an essential role in the training, evaluation, and refinement of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of principled understanding in evaluating the quality of the critique itself. In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed MetaCritique, which is a framework to evaluate the critique from two aspects, i.e., factuality as precision score and comprehensiveness as recall score. We calculate the harmonic mean of precision and recall as the overall rating called F1 score. To obtain a reliable evaluation outcome, we propose Atomic Information Units (AIUs), which describe the critique in a more fine-grained manner. MetaCritique takes each AIU into account and aggregates each AIU's judgment for the overall score. Moreover, given the evaluation process involves intricate reasoning, our MetaCritique provides a natural language rationale to support each judgment. We construct a meta-evaluation dataset containing 300 critiques (2653 AIUs) across four tasks (question answering, reasoning, entailment, and summarization), and we conduct a comparative study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness. Experiments also show superior critique judged by MetaCritique leads to better refinement, indicating generative artificial intelligence indeed has the potential to be significantly advanced with our MetaCritique.

|**2024-01-08**|**Unveiling Bias in Fairness Evaluations of Large Language Models: A Critical Literature Review of Music and Movie Recommendation Systems**|The rise of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has intensified the imperative to scrutinize fairness alongside accuracy. Recent studies have begun to investigate fairness evaluations for LLMs within domains such as recommendations. Given that personalization is an intrinsic aspect of recommendation systems, its incorporation into fairness assessments is paramount. Yet, the degree to which current fairness evaluation frameworks account for personalization remains unclear. Our comprehensive literature review aims to fill this gap by examining how existing frameworks handle fairness evaluations of LLMs, with a focus on the integration of personalization factors. Despite an exhaustive collection and analysis of relevant works, we discovered that most evaluations overlook personalization, a critical facet of recommendation systems, thereby inadvertently perpetuating unfair practices. Our findings shed light on this oversight and underscore the urgent need for more nuanced fairness evaluations that acknowledge personalization. Such improvements are vital for fostering equitable development within the AI community. et.al.|[2401.04057](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04057)|null|

We show that on a classic benchmark on scientific document retrieval in the medical domain of cystic fibrosis, that both of these models perform roughly equivalently. Notably, dense vectors from the state-of-the-art SPECTER2 model do not significantly enhance performance. However, a hybrid model that we propose combining these methods yields significantly better results, underscoring the merits of integrating classical and contemporary deep learning techniques in information retrieval in the domain of specialized scientific documents. et.al.|[2401.04055](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04055)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**Advancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models: An In-Depth Evaluation and Enhancement Using the StepGame Benchmark**|Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress across various domains, with large language models like ChatGPT gaining substantial attention for their human-like text-generation capabilities. Despite these achievements, spatial reasoning remains a significant challenge for these models. Benchmarks like StepGame evaluate AI spatial reasoning, where ChatGPT has shown unsatisfactory performance. However, the presence of template errors in the benchmark has an impact on the evaluation results. Thus there is potential for ChatGPT to perform better if these template errors are addressed, leading to more accurate assessments of its spatial reasoning capabilities. In this study, we refine the StepGame benchmark, providing a more accurate dataset for model evaluation. We analyze GPT's spatial reasoning performance on the rectified benchmark, identifying proficiency in mapping natural language text to spatial relations but limitations in multi-hop reasoning. We provide a flawless solution to the benchmark by combining template-to-relation mapping with logic-based reasoning. This combination demonstrates proficiency in performing qualitative reasoning on StepGame without encountering any errors. We then address the limitations of GPT models in spatial reasoning. We deploy Chain-of-thought and Tree-of-thoughts prompting strategies, offering insights into GPT's ``cognitive process", and achieving remarkable improvements in accuracy. Our investigation not only sheds light on model deficiencies but also proposes enhancements, contributing to the advancement of AI with more robust spatial reasoning capabilities. et.al.|[2401.03991](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03991)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**TTMs: Fast Multi-level Tiny Time Mixers for Improved Zero-shot and Few-shot Forecasting of Multivariate Time Series**|Large Pretrained models for Zero/Few-shot learning excel in language and vision domains but encounter challenges in multivariate time series (TS) due to the diverse nature and scarcity of publicly available pretraining data. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in utilizing pretrained large language models (LLMs) with various adaptations for time series forecasting. These approaches employ cross-domain transfer learning, yielding highly impressive results. However, these models are typically very large ( $\sim$ billion parameters), exhibit slow execution, and do not consider cross-channel correlations. To address this, we present Multi-level Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a significantly smaller model based on the lightweight TSMixer architecture. TTM marks the first success in developing tiny pretrained models ($\le$ 1 million parameters), exclusively trained on public TS data with effective transfer learning capabilities. To tackle the complexity of pretraining on multiple datasets with varied temporal resolutions, we introduce several novel enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling, and resolution prefix tuning. Moreover, we employ a multi-level modeling strategy to effectively model channel correlations and incorporate exogenous signals during finetuning, a crucial capability lacking in existing benchmarks. TTM excels in few/zero-shot forecasting, demonstrating significant accuracy gains (12-38%) over existing benchmarks. Further, it achieves a remarkable 14-106X reduction in model parameters, enabling 54-65X faster training/inference as compared to the LLM-TS benchmarks. In fact, TTM's zero-shot results often surpass the few-shot results in many benchmarks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Code and Pretrained Models will be open-sourced. et.al.|[2401.03955](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03955)|null|

However, easy access to LLMs is posing new challenges due to misuse. To address malicious usage, researchers have released datasets to effectively train models on MGT-related tasks. Similar strategies are used to compile these datasets, but no tool currently unifies them. In this scenario, we introduce TextMachina, a modular and extensible Python framework, designed to aid in the creation of high-quality, unbiased datasets to build robust models for MGT-related tasks such as detection, attribution, or boundary detection. It provides a user-friendly pipeline that abstracts away the inherent intricacies of building MGT datasets, such as LLM integrations, prompt templating, and bias mitigation. The quality of the datasets generated by TextMachina has been assessed in previous works, including shared tasks where more than one hundred teams trained robust MGT detectors. et.al.|[2401.03946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03946)|null|

Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated promising performance in simulating human society. Can we leverage LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? However, current LLM-based multi-agent systems mainly rely on text as the primary medium. In this paper, we propose SpeechAgents, a multi-modal LLM based multi-agent system designed for simulating human communication. SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLM as the control center for individual agent and employes multi-modal signals as the medium for exchanged messages among agents. Additionally, we propose Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without compromising general abilities. To strengthen and evaluate the effectiveness of human communication simulation, we build the Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SpeechAgents can simulate human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions and demonstrate excellent scalability even with up to 25 agents, which can apply to tasks such as drama creation and audio novels generation.

This has prompted ongoing disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article -- the first part of two companion papers -- serves both as a primer on language models for philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their latest developments. et.al.|[2401.03910](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03910)|null|
|**2024-01-08**|**FlightLLM: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with a Complete Mapping Flow on FPGA**|Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have made a significant impact on various domains. However, LLMs' efficiency suffers from both heavy computation and memory overheads. Compression techniques like sparsification and quantization are commonly used to mitigate the gap between LLM's computation/memory overheads and hardware capacity. However, existing GPU and transformer-based accelerators cannot efficiently process compressed LLMs, due to the following unresolved challenges: low computational efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads.   This paper proposes FlightLLM, enabling efficient LLMs inference with a complete mapping flow on FPGAs. In FlightLLM, we highlight an innovative solution that the computation and memory overhead of LLMs can be solved by utilizing FPGA-specific resources (e.g., DSP48 and heterogeneous memory hierarchy). We propose a configurable sparse DSP chain to support different sparsity patterns with high computation efficiency. Second, we propose an always-on-chip decode scheme to boost memory bandwidth with mixed-precision support. Finally, to make FlightLLM available for real-world LLMs, we propose a length adaptive compilation method to reduce the compilation overhead. Implemented on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, FlightLLM achieves 6.0 $\times$ higher energy efficiency and 1.8$\times$ better cost efficiency against commercial GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100S) on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2-7B) using vLLM and SmoothQuant under the batch size of one. FlightLLM beats NVIDIA A100 GPU with 1.2$\times$ higher throughput using the latest Versal VHK158 FPGA. et.al.|[2401.03868](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03868)|null|

This study presents a large-scale human evaluation of HumanEval and MBPP, two widely used benchmarks for Python code generation, focusing on their diversity and difficulty. Our findings reveal a significant bias towards a limited number of programming concepts, with negligible or no representation of most concepts.

|**2024-01-08**|**Aligned with LLM: a new multi-modal training paradigm for encoding fMRI activity in visual cortex**|Recently, there has been a surge in the popularity of pre trained large language models (LLMs) (such as GPT-4), sweeping across the entire Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) communities. These LLMs have demonstrated advanced multi-modal understanding capabilities and showcased strong performance across various benchmarks. The LLM has started to embody traits of artificial general intelligence, which holds vital guidance for enhancing brain-like characteristics within visual encoding models. Hence, This paper proposes a new multi-modal training paradigm, aligning with LLM, for encoding fMRI activity in visual cortex. Based on this paradigm, we trained an encoding model in fMRI data named the LLM-Visual Encoding Model (LLM-VEM). Specifically, we utilize LLM (miniGPT4) to generate descriptive text for all stimulus images, forming a high-quality textual description set. Moreover, we use the pre-trained text encoder (CLIP) to process these detailed descriptions, obtaining the text embedding features. Next, we use the contrast loss function to minimize the distance between the image embedding features and the text embedding features to complete the alignment operation of the stimulus image and text information. With the assistance of the pre-trained LLM, this alignment process facilitates better learning of the visual encoding model, resulting in higher precision. The final experimental results indicate that our training paradigm has significantly aided in enhancing the performance of the visual encoding model. et.al.|[2401.03851](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03851)|null|

However, the scaling law described in previous literature presents varying conclusions, which casts a dark cloud over scaling LLMs. We delve into the study of scaling laws and present our distinctive findings that facilitate scaling of large scale models in two commonly used open-source configurations, 7B and 67B. Guided by the scaling laws, we introduce DeepSeek LLM, a project dedicated to advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective. To support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2 trillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the creation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM 67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B on various benchmarks, particularly in the domains of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that DeepSeek LLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5. et.al.|[2401.02954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02954)|null|
|**2024-01-05**|**Towards ASR Robust Spoken Language Understanding Through In-Context Learning With Word Confusion Networks**|In the realm of spoken language understanding (SLU), numerous natural language understanding (NLU) methodologies have been adapted by supplying large language models (LLMs) with transcribed speech instead of conventional written text. In real-world scenarios, prior to input into an LLM, an automated speech recognition (ASR) system generates an output transcript hypothesis, where inherent errors can degrade subsequent SLU tasks. Here we introduce a method that utilizes the ASR system's lattice output instead of relying solely on the top hypothesis, aiming to encapsulate speech ambiguities and enhance SLU outcomes. Our in-context learning experiments, covering spoken question answering and intent classification, underline the LLM's resilience to noisy speech transcripts with the help of word confusion networks from lattices, bridging the SLU performance gap between using the top ASR hypothesis and an oracle upper bound. Additionally, we delve into the LLM's robustness to varying ASR performance conditions and scrutinize the aspects of in-context learning which prove the most influential. et.al.|[2401.02921](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02921)|null|
|**2024-01-05**|**Introducing Bode: A Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Portuguese Prompt-Based Task**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bringing advances to Natural Language Processing. However, low-resource languages, those lacking extensive prominence in datasets for various NLP tasks, or where existing datasets are not as substantial, such as Portuguese, already obtain several benefits from LLMs, but not to the same extent. LLMs trained on multilingual datasets normally struggle to respond to prompts in Portuguese satisfactorily, presenting, for example, code switching in their responses. This work proposes a fine-tuned LLaMA 2-based model for Portuguese prompts named Bode in two versions: 7B and 13B. We evaluate the performance of this model in classification tasks using the zero-shot approach with in-context learning, and compare it with other LLMs. Our main contribution is to bring an LLM with satisfactory results in the Portuguese language, as well as to provide a model that is free for research or commercial purposes. et.al.|[2401.02909](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02909)|null|
|**2024-01-05**|**MLLM-Protector: Ensuring MLLM's Safety without Hurting Performance**|The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought forth a unique vulnerability: susceptibility to malicious attacks through visual inputs. We delve into the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. We discovered that images act as a "foreign language" that is not considered during alignment, which can make MLLMs prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover the possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that open-source MLLMs are predominantly fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that is much less than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during explicit alignment tuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a plug-and-play strategy combining a lightweight harm detector and a response detoxifier. The harm detector's role is to identify potentially harmful outputs from the MLLM, while the detoxifier corrects these outputs to ensure the response stipulates to the safety standards. This approach effectively mitigates the risks posed by malicious visual inputs without compromising the model's overall performance. Our results demonstrate that MLLM-Protector offers a robust solution to a previously unaddressed aspect of MLLM security. et.al.|[2401.02906](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02906)|**[link](https://github.com/pipilurj/mllm-protector)**|

Recent research has employed LLM-based Agents to create a sociological research environment, in which agents exhibit behavior based on the unfiltered characteristics of large language models. However, these studies overlook the iterative development within a human-like setting - Human preferences and personalities are complex, shaped by various factors and subject to ongoing change as a result of environmental and subjective influences. In light of this observation, we propose Agent Framework for Shaping Preference and Personality (AFSPP), exploring the multifaceted impact of social networks and subjective consciousness on LLM-based Agents' preference and personality formation. With AFSPP, we have, for the first time, successfully replicated several key findings from human personality experiments. And other AFSPP-based experimental results indicate that plan making, sensory perceptions and social networking with subjective information, wield the most pronounced influence on preference shaping. AFSPP can significantly enhance the efficiency and scope of psychological experiments, while yielding valuable insights for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence research for strategies to prevent undesirable preference and personality development. et.al.|[2401.02870](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02870)|null|

The practice of EBM faces challenges due to rapid advancements in medical research, leading to information overload for clinicians. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), offers a promising solution towards managing this complexity.   Methods: This study involved the curation of real-world clinical cases across various specialties, converting them into .json files for analysis. LLMs, including proprietary models like ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, Gemini Pro, and open-source models like LLaMA v2 and Mixtral-8x7B, were employed. These models were equipped with tools to retrieve information from case files and make clinical decisions similar to how clinicians must operate in the real world. Model performance was evaluated based on correctness of final answer, judicious use of tools, conformity to guidelines, and resistance to hallucinations.   Results: GPT-4 was most capable of autonomous operation in a clinical setting, being generally more effective in ordering relevant investigations and conforming to clinical guidelines. Limitations were observed in terms of model ability to handle complex guidelines and diagnostic nuances. Retrieval Augmented Generation made recommendations more tailored to patients and healthcare systems.   Conclusions: LLMs can be made to function as autonomous practitioners of evidence-based medicine. Their ability to utilize tooling can be harnessed to interact with the infrastructure of a real-world healthcare system and perform the tasks of patient management in a guideline directed manner.

If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047. The latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey we conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of all human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by 2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).   Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that "substantial" or "extreme" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality.

Integrating such advancements in speech generation with large language models might revolutionize a wide range of applications. However, certain applications, such as assistive conversational systems, require natural and conversational speech generation tools that also operate efficiently in real time. Current state-of-the-art models like VALL-E and SoundStorm, powered by hierarchical neural audio codecs, require large neural components and extensive training data to work well. In contrast, MQTTS aims to build more compact conversational TTS models while capitalizing on smaller-scale real-life conversational speech data. However, its autoregressive nature yields high inference latency and thus limits its real-time usage. In order to mitigate the current limitations of the state-of-the-art TTS models while capitalizing on their strengths, in this work we introduce the Pheme model series that 1) offers compact yet high-performing models, 2) allows for parallel speech generation of 3) natural conversational speech, and 4) it can be trained efficiently on smaller-scale conversational data, cutting data demands by more than 10x but still matching the quality of the autoregressive TTS models. We also show that through simple teacher-student distillation we can meet significant improvements in voice quality for single-speaker setups on top of pretrained Pheme checkpoints, relying solely on synthetic speech generated by much larger teacher models.

However, adapting these models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by learning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these works require labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize towards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternative approach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from large language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, these methods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to other classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each class separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these both streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from LLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of images, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich contextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped within the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new classes and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized prompts using text only data. We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks where our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive to those utilizing labeled images.

|**2024-01-04**|**DIALIGHT: Lightweight Multilingual Development and Evaluation of Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Large Language Models**|We present DIALIGHT, a toolkit for developing and evaluating multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue (ToD) systems which facilitates systematic evaluations and comparisons between ToD systems using fine-tuning of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and those utilising the zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to automatic evaluation, this toolkit features (i) a secure, user-friendly web interface for fine-grained human evaluation at both local utterance level and global dialogue level, and (ii) a microservice-based backend, improving efficiency and scalability. Our evaluations reveal that while PLM fine-tuning leads to higher accuracy and coherence, LLM-based systems excel in producing diverse and likeable responses. However, we also identify significant challenges of LLMs in adherence to task-specific instructions and generating outputs in multiple languages, highlighting areas for future research. We hope this open-sourced toolkit will serve as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop and properly evaluate multilingual ToD systems and will lower, currently still high, entry barriers in the field. et.al.|[2401.02208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02208)|null|

The continuous multi-modal large language models (MLLM) empower LLMs with the ability to perceive visual signals. The launch of GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) has generated significant interest in the research communities. GPT-4V(ison) has demonstrated significant power in both academia and industry fields, as a focal point in a new artificial intelligence generation. Though significant success was achieved by GPT-4V, exploring MLLMs in domain-specific analysis (e.g., marine analysis) that required domain-specific knowledge and expertise has gained less attention. In this study, we carry out the preliminary and comprehensive case study of utilizing GPT-4V for marine analysis. This report conducts a systematic evaluation of existing GPT-4V, assessing the performance of GPT-4V on marine research and also setting a new standard for future developments in MLLMs. The experimental results of GPT-4V show that the responses generated by GPT-4V are still far away from satisfying the domain-specific requirements of the marine professions.

|**2024-01-04**|**DCR-Consistency: Divide-Conquer-Reasoning for Consistency Evaluation and Improvement of Large Language Models**|Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge. Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence. This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach. Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks. Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation. et.al.|[2401.02132](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02132)|null|

To address these gaps, we introduce ICE-GRT, utilizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) grounded in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrating remarkable ability in in-domain scenarios without compromising general task performance. Our exploration of ICE-GRT highlights its understanding and reasoning ability to not only generate robust answers but also to provide detailed analyses of the reasons behind the answer. This capability marks a significant progression beyond the scope of Supervised Fine-Tuning models. The success of ICE-GRT is dependent on several crucial factors, including Appropriate Data, Reward Size Scaling, KL-Control, Advantage Normalization, etc. The ICE-GRT model exhibits state-of-the-art performance in domain-specific tasks and across 12 general Language tasks against equivalent size and even larger size LLMs, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the ICE-GRT, underscoring the significant advancements it brings to the field of LLM. et.al.|[2401.02072](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02072)|null|
|**2024-01-04**|**An Example of Evolutionary Computation + Large Language Model Beating Human: Design of Efficient Guided Local Search**|It is often very tedious for human experts to design efficient algorithms. Recently, we have proposed a novel Algorithm Evolution using Large Language Model (AEL) framework for automatic algorithm design. AEL combines the power of a large language model and the paradigm of evolutionary computation to design, combine, and modify algorithms automatically. In this paper, we use AEL to design the guide algorithm for guided local search (GLS) to solve the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP). AEL automatically evolves elite GLS algorithms in two days, with minimal human effort and no model training. Experimental results on 1,000 TSP20-TSP100 instances and TSPLib instances show that AEL-designed GLS outperforms state-of-the-art human-designed GLS with the same iteration budget. It achieves a 0% gap on TSP20 and TSP50 and a 0.032% gap on TSP100 in 1,000 iterations.

|**2024-01-03**|**Mining Temporal Attack Patterns from Cyberthreat Intelligence Reports**|Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns. et.al.|[2401.01883](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01883)|null|

We systematically evaluate LLMs' abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore, experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images generated with text models, highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just LLMs. et.al.|[2401.01862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01862)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Multilingual Instruction Tuning With Just a Pinch of Multilinguality**|As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly crucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model acquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another language. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the instruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses. et.al.|[2401.01854](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01854)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Large Language Models Relearn Removed Concepts**|Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models. However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining. Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}. Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal. et.al.|[2401.01814](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01814)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Navigating Uncertainty: Optimizing API Dependency for Hallucination Reduction in Closed-Book Question Answering**|While Large Language Models (LLM) are able to accumulate and restore knowledge, they are still prone to hallucination. Especially when faced with factual questions, LLM cannot only rely on knowledge stored in parameters to guarantee truthful and correct answers. Augmenting these models with the ability to search on external information sources, such as the web, is a promising approach to ground knowledge to retrieve information. However, searching in a large collection of documents introduces additional computational/time costs. An optimal behavior would be to query external resources only when the LLM is not confident about answers. In this paper, we propose a new LLM able to self-estimate if it is able to answer directly or needs to request an external tool. We investigate a supervised approach by introducing a hallucination masking mechanism in which labels are generated using a close book question-answering task. In addition, we propose to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to train our model on a small amount of data. Our model directly provides answers for $78.2\%$ of the known queries and opts to search for $77.2\%$ of the unknown ones. This results in the API being utilized only $62\%$ of the time. et.al.|[2401.01780](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01780)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Cross-target Stance Detection by Exploiting Target Analytical Perspectives**|Cross-target stance detection (CTSD) is an important task, which infers the attitude of the destination target by utilizing annotated data derived from the source target. One important approach in CTSD is to extract domain-invariant features to bridge the knowledge gap between multiple targets. However, the analysis of informal and short text structure, and implicit expressions, complicate the extraction of domain-invariant knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Perspective Prompt-Tuning (MPPT) model for CTSD that uses the analysis perspective as a bridge to transfer knowledge. First, we develop a two-stage instruct-based chain-of-thought method (TsCoT) to elicit target analysis perspectives and provide natural language explanations (NLEs) from multiple viewpoints by formulating instructions based on large language model (LLM). Second, we propose a multi-perspective prompt-tuning framework (MultiPLN) to fuse the NLEs into the stance predictor. Extensive experiments results demonstrate the superiority of MPPT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods. et.al.|[2401.01761](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01761)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Economics Arena for Large Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for general-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are capable of playing various types of economics games. Following these works, to overcome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose to explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate multi-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history revealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that they play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as indicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available, certain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies, which suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the meantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are available, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability with respect to the strategies of other players. Throughout all our experiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules described by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested. In this work, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a dynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e. rationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability. et.al.|[2401.01735](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01735)|null|
|**2024-01-03**|**Evaluating Large Language Models in Semantic Parsing for Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs**|Conversational question answering systems often rely on semantic parsing to enable interactive information retrieval, which involves the generation of structured database queries from a natural language input. For information-seeking conversations about facts stored within a knowledge graph, dialogue utterances are transformed into graph queries in a process that is called knowledge-based conversational question answering. This paper evaluates the performance of large language models that have not been explicitly pre-trained on this task. Through a series of experiments on an extensive benchmark dataset, we compare models of varying sizes with different prompting techniques and identify common issue types in the generated output. Our results demonstrate that large language models are capable of generating graph queries from dialogues, with significant improvements achievable through few-shot prompting and fine-tuning techniques, especially for smaller models that exhibit lower zero-shot performance. et.al.|[2401.01711](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01711)|**[link](https://github.com/sebischair/llm-sp-cqa)**|
|**2024-01-03**|**De-Hallucinator: Iterative Grounding for LLM-Based Code Completion**|Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion. However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs. Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code. Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt. The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs. De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects. We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor. In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline. et.al.|[2401.01701](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01701)|null|

We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs.

|**2024-01-02**|**Self-Play Fine-Tuning Converts Weak Language Models to Strong Language Models**|Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents. et.al.|[2401.01335](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**LLM Maybe LongLM: Self-Extend LLM Context Window Without Tuning**|This work elicits LLMs' inherent ability to handle long contexts without fine-tuning. The limited length of the training sequence during training may limit the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long input sequences for inference. In this work, we argue that existing LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities for handling long contexts. Based on this argument, we suggest extending LLMs' context window by themselves to fully utilize the inherent ability.We propose Self-Extend to stimulate LLMs' long context handling potential. The basic idea is to construct bi-level attention information: the group level and the neighbor level. The two levels are computed by the original model's self-attention, which means the proposed does not require any training. With only four lines of code modification, the proposed method can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the results show that the proposed method can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window's length. et.al.|[2401.01325](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01325)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models**|As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs. et.al.|[2401.01313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01313)|null|

We investigate the extent of these hallucinations using an original suite of legal queries, comparing LLMs' responses to structured legal metadata and examining their consistency. Our work makes four key contributions: (1) We develop a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this area. (2) We find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent, occurring between 69% of the time with ChatGPT 3.5 and 88% with Llama 2, when these models are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal court cases. (3) We illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a user's incorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. (4) We provide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when they are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, these findings caution against the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal tasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and the risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro se litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources. et.al.|[2401.01301](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01301)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**A Comprehensive Study of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models**|Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications. et.al.|[2401.01286](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01286)|**[link](https://github.com/zjunlp/easyedit)**|

|**2024-01-02**|**Fairness Certification for Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models**|Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an important role in our daily lives, particularly due to the enormous progress of Large Language Models (LLM). However, NLP has many fairness-critical use cases, e.g., as an expert system in recruitment or as an LLM-based tutor in education. Since NLP is based on human language, potentially harmful biases can diffuse into NLP systems and produce unfair results, discriminate against minorities or generate legal issues. Hence, it is important to develop a fairness certification for NLP approaches. We follow a qualitative research approach towards a fairness certification for NLP. In particular, we have reviewed a large body of literature on algorithmic fairness, and we have conducted semi-structured expert interviews with a wide range of experts from that area. We have systematically devised six fairness criteria for NLP, which can be further refined into 18 sub-categories. Our criteria offer a foundation for operationalizing and testing processes to certify fairness, both from the perspective of the auditor and the audited organization. et.al.|[2401.01262](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01262)|null|
|**2024-01-02**|**VideoDrafter: Content-Consistent Multi-Scene Video Generation with LLM**|The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely VideoDrafter, for content-consistent multi-scene video generation. Technically, VideoDrafter leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as camera movement. VideoDrafter identifies the common entities throughout the script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each entity. Finally, VideoDrafter outputs a multi-scene video by generating each scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoDrafter outperforms the SOTA video generation models in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference. et.al.|[2401.01256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01256)|null|
|**2023-12-29**|**Jatmo: Prompt Injection Defense by Task-Specific Finetuning**|Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks. However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks. Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning. It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model). Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs. For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset. Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections. The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus over 90% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense. et.al.|[2312.17673](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17673)|null|

These models enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced visual understanding capabilities, facilitating their application in a variety of multimodal tasks. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a cutting-edge MLLM designed specifically for multimodal integration. Despite its advancements, preliminary benchmarks indicate that Gemini lags behind GPT models in commonsense reasoning tasks. However, this assessment, based on a limited dataset (i.e., HellaSWAG), does not fully capture Gemini's authentic commonsense reasoning potential. To address this gap, our study undertakes a thorough evaluation of Gemini's performance in complex reasoning tasks that necessitate the integration of commonsense knowledge across modalities. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of 12 commonsense reasoning datasets, ranging from general to domain-specific tasks. This includes 11 datasets focused solely on language, as well as one that incorporates multimodal elements. Our experiments across four LLMs and two MLLMs demonstrate Gemini's competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we identify common challenges faced by current LLMs and MLLMs in addressing commonsense problems, underscoring the need for further advancements in enhancing the commonsense reasoning abilities of these models. et.al.|[2312.17661](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17661)|**[link](https://github.com/eternityyw/gemini-commonsense-evaluation)**|
|**2023-12-29**|**Large Language Models for Generative Information Extraction: A Survey**|Information extraction (IE) aims to extract structural knowledge (such as entities, relations, and events) from plain natural language texts. Recently, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, allowing for generalization across various domains and tasks. As a result, numerous works have been proposed to harness abilities of LLMs and offer viable solutions for IE tasks based on a generative paradigm. To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and exploration of LLM efforts for IE tasks, in this study, we survey the most recent advancements in this field. We first present an extensive overview by categorizing these works in terms of various IE subtasks and learning paradigms, then we empirically analyze the most advanced methods and discover the emerging trend of IE tasks with LLMs. Based on thorough review conducted, we identify several insights in technique and promising research directions that deserve further exploration in future studies.

|**2023-12-29**|**Action-Item-Driven Summarization of Long Meeting Transcripts**|The increased prevalence of online meetings has significantly enhanced the practicality of a model that can automatically generate the summary of a given meeting. This paper introduces a novel and effective approach to automate the generation of meeting summaries. Current approaches to this problem generate general and basic summaries, considering the meeting simply as a long dialogue. However, our novel algorithms can generate abstractive meeting summaries that are driven by the action items contained in the meeting transcript. This is done by recursively generating summaries and employing our action-item extraction algorithm for each section of the meeting in parallel. All of these sectional summaries are then combined and summarized together to create a coherent and action-item-driven summary. In addition, this paper introduces three novel methods for dividing up long transcripts into topic-based sections to improve the time efficiency of our algorithm, as well as to resolve the issue of large language models (LLMs) forgetting long-term dependencies. Our pipeline achieved a BERTScore of 64.98 across the AMI corpus, which is an approximately 4.98% increase from the current state-of-the-art result produced by a fine-tuned BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model. et.al.|[2312.17581](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17581)|**[link](https://github.com/logangolia/meeting-summarization)**|
|**2023-12-29**|**Building Efficient Universal Classifiers with Natural Language Inference**|Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the mainstream choice for fewshot and zeroshot learning thanks to the universality of text generation. Many users, however, do not need the broad capabilities of generative LLMs when they only want to automate a classification task. Smaller BERT-like models can also learn universal tasks, which allow them to do any text classification task without requiring fine-tuning (zeroshot classification) or to learn new tasks with only a few examples (fewshot), while being significantly more efficient than generative LLMs. This paper (1) explains how Natural Language Inference (NLI) can be used as a universal classification task that follows similar principles as instruction fine-tuning of generative LLMs, (2) provides a step-by-step guide with reusable Jupyter notebooks for building a universal classifier, and (3) shares the resulting universal classifier that is trained on 33 datasets with 389 diverse classes. Parts of the code we share has been used to train our older zeroshot classifiers that have been downloaded more than 55 million times via the Hugging Face Hub as of December 2023.

|**2023-12-29**|**Enhancing Quantitative Reasoning Skills of Large Language Models through Dimension Perception**|Quantities are distinct and critical components of texts that characterize the magnitude properties of entities, providing a precise perspective for the understanding of natural language, especially for reasoning tasks. In recent years, there has been a flurry of research on reasoning tasks based on large language models (LLMs), most of which solely focus on numerical values, neglecting the dimensional concept of quantities with units despite its importance. We argue that the concept of dimension is essential for precisely understanding quantities and of great significance for LLMs to perform quantitative reasoning. However, the lack of dimension knowledge and quantity-related benchmarks has resulted in low performance of LLMs. Hence, we present a framework to enhance the quantitative reasoning ability of language models based on dimension perception. We first construct a dimensional unit knowledge base (DimUnitKB) to address the knowledge gap in this area. We propose a benchmark DimEval consisting of seven tasks of three categories to probe and enhance the dimension perception skills of LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we propose a quantitative reasoning task and conduct experiments. The experimental results show that our dimension perception method dramatically improves accuracy (43.55%->50.67%) on quantitative reasoning tasks compared to GPT-4. et.al.|[2312.17532](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17532)|null|

|**2023-12-29**|**Cooperation on the Fly: Exploring Language Agents for Ad Hoc Teamwork in the Avalon Game**|Multi-agent collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates proficiency in basic tasks, yet its efficiency in more complex scenarios remains unexplored. In gaming environments, these agents often face situations without established coordination protocols, requiring them to make intelligent inferences about teammates from limited data. This problem motivates the area of ad hoc teamwork, in which an agent may potentially cooperate with a variety of teammates to achieve a shared goal. Our study focuses on the ad hoc teamwork problem where the agent operates in an environment driven by natural language. Our findings reveal the potential of LLM agents in team collaboration, highlighting issues related to hallucinations in communication. To address this issue, we develop CodeAct, a general agent that equips LLM with enhanced memory and code-driven reasoning, enabling the repurposing of partial information for rapid adaptation to new teammates. et.al.|[2312.17515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17515)|null|
|**2023-12-29**|**Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Model Using Federated Learning**|The surge in interest and application of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a drive to fine-tune these models to suit specific applications, such as finance and medical science. However, concerns regarding data privacy have emerged, especially when multiple stakeholders aim to collaboratively enhance LLMs using sensitive data. In this scenario, federated learning becomes a natural choice, allowing decentralized fine-tuning without exposing raw data to central servers. Motivated by this, we investigate how data privacy can be ensured in LLM fine-tuning through practical federated learning approaches, enabling secure contributions from multiple parties to enhance LLMs. Yet, challenges arise: 1) despite avoiding raw data exposure, there is a risk of inferring sensitive information from model outputs, and 2) federated learning for LLMs incurs notable communication overhead. To address these challenges, this article introduces DP-LoRA, a novel federated learning algorithm tailored for LLMs. DP-LoRA preserves data privacy by employing a Gaussian mechanism that adds noise in weight updates, maintaining individual data privacy while facilitating collaborative model training. Moreover, DP-LoRA optimizes communication efficiency via low-rank adaptation, minimizing the transmission of updated weights during distributed training. The experimental results across medical, financial, and general datasets using various LLMs demonstrate that DP-LoRA effectively ensures strict privacy constraints while minimizing communication overhead. et.al.|[2312.17493](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17493)|null|
|**2023-12-29**|**The Right Prompts for the Job: Repair Code-Review Defects with Large Language Model**|Automatic program repair (APR) techniques have the potential to reduce manual efforts in uncovering and repairing program defects during the code review (CR) process. However, the limited accuracy and considerable time costs associated with existing APR approaches hinder their adoption in industrial practice. One key factor is the under-utilization of review comments, which provide valuable insights into defects and potential fixes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced their ability to comprehend natural and programming languages, enabling them to generate patches based on review comments. This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into the effective utilization of LLMs for repairing CR defects. In this study, various prompts are designed and compared across mainstream LLMs using two distinct datasets from human reviewers and automated checkers.

|**2023-12-28**|**The LLM Surgeon**|State-of-the-art language models are becoming increasingly large in an effort to achieve the highest performance on large corpora of available textual data. However, the sheer size of the Transformer architectures makes it difficult to deploy models within computational, environmental or device-specific constraints. We explore data-driven compression of existing pretrained models as an alternative to training smaller models from scratch. To do so, we scale Kronecker-factored curvature approximations of the target loss landscape to large language models. In doing so, we can compute both the dynamic allocation of structures that can be removed as well as updates of remaining weights that account for the removal. We provide a general framework for unstructured, semi-structured and structured pruning and improve upon weight updates to capture more correlations between weights, while remaining computationally efficient. Experimentally, our method can prune rows and columns from a range of OPT models and Llamav2-7B by 20%-30%, with a negligible loss in performance, and achieve state-of-the-art results in unstructured and semi-structured pruning of large language models. et.al.|[2312.17244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17244)|null|
|**2023-12-28**|**An Improved Baseline for Reasoning Segmentation with Large Language Model**|While LISA effectively bridges the gap between segmentation and large language models to enable reasoning segmentation, it poses certain limitations: unable to distinguish different instances of the target region, and constrained by the pre-defined textual response formats. In this work, we introduce LISA++, an update to the existing LISA model, focusing on improving core functionalities while keeping the base architecture intact. The main enhancements in LISA++ include: \textbf{1) Enhanced Segmentation}: The instance segmentation ability has been added, providing a more detailed scene analysis along with the existing multi-region semantic segmentation. \textbf{2) More Natural Conversation}: Improved capability for multi-turn dialogue, with the ability to incorporate segmentation results directly into text responses, i.e., Segmentation in Dialogue (SiD). These improvements are achieved by curating the existing samples of generic segmentation datasets, aimed specifically at enhancing the segmentation and conversational skills without structural change and additional data sources. Comparative analysis with the original LISA model shows significant advancements in these areas, positioning LISA++ as a notable upgrade in visual understanding and interaction. LISA++'s adaptability and improved features highlight the versatility of the mask-as-embedding paradigm proposed by LISA, and the potential as a foundational model for diverse applications. et.al.|[2312.17240](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17240)|null|
|**2023-12-28**|**Fast Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models with Offloading**|With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), many deep learning practitioners are looking for strategies of running these models more efficiently. One such strategy is to use sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) - a type of model architectures where only a fraction of model layers are active for any given input. This property allows MoE-based language models to generate tokens faster than their dense counterparts, but it also increases model size due to having multiple experts. Unfortunately, this makes state-of-the-art MoE language models difficult to run without high-end GPUs. In this work, we study the problem of running large MoE language models on consumer hardware with limited accelerator memory. We build upon parameter offloading algorithms and propose a novel strategy that accelerates offloading by taking advantage of innate properties of MoE LLMs. Using this strategy, we build can run Mixtral-8x7B with mixed quantization on desktop hardware and free-tier Google Colab instances. et.al.|[2312.17238](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17238)|**[link](https://github.com/dvmazur/mixtral-offloading)**|
|**2023-12-28**|**A Simple LLM Framework for Long-Range Video Question-Answering**|We present LLoVi, a language-based framework for long-range video question-answering (LVQA). Unlike prior long-range video understanding methods, which are often costly and require specialized long-range video modeling design (e.g., memory queues, state-space layers, etc.), our approach uses a frame/clip-level visual captioner (e.g., BLIP2, LaViLa, LLaVA) coupled with a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) leading to a simple yet surprisingly effective LVQA framework. Specifically, we decompose short and long-range modeling aspects of LVQA into two stages. First, we use a short-term visual captioner to generate textual descriptions of short video clips (0.5-8s in length) densely sampled from a long input video. Afterward, an LLM aggregates the densely extracted short-term captions to perform long-range temporal reasoning needed to understand the whole video and answer a question. To analyze what makes our simple framework so effective, we thoroughly evaluate various components of our system. Our empirical analysis reveals that the choice of the visual captioner and LLM is critical for good LVQA performance. Furthermore, we show that a specialized prompt that asks the LLM first to summarize the noisy short-term visual captions and then answer a given input question leads to a significant LVQA performance boost. On EgoSchema, which is best known as a very long-form video question-answering benchmark, our method achieves 50.3% accuracy, outperforming the previous best-performing approach by 18.1% (absolute gain). In addition, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.1% and 3.1% on NeXT-QA and IntentQA. We also extend LLoVi to grounded LVQA and show that it outperforms all prior methods on the NeXT-GQA dataset.

We provide the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for pretrained large language models (LLMs), indicating that language models are capable of discovering regularities that generalize to unseen data. In particular, we derive a compression bound that is valid for the unbounded log-likelihood loss using prediction smoothing, and we extend the bound to handle subsampling, accelerating bound computation on massive datasets. To achieve the extreme level of compression required for non-vacuous generalization bounds, we devise SubLoRA, a low-dimensional non-linear parameterization. Using this approach, we find that larger models have better generalization bounds and are more compressible than smaller models. et.al.|[2312.17173](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17173)|null|

A Framework for Evaluating the Believability of Human Behavior Simulation**|Human behavior simulation of AI agents necessitates the agents to possess a quality of believability, which is crucial as it facilitates users in establishing trust toward the agents and streamlines the fulfillment of the agents' goal. While recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have improved human behavior simulation, challenges inherent to LLMs (e.g., long context modeling) can undermine their believability. Consequently, evaluating AI agent believability becomes imperative. Unfortunately, prior research often neglects the negative impacts of LLM deficiencies. To address these gaps, we introduce two metrics for assessing LLM-based agent believability: consistency, and robustness, together with a benchmark, SimulateBench, with which, we evaluate the consistency and robustness of agents implemented with popular LLMs. We find that agents (i) struggle to accurately depict character information when presented with lengthy profile inputs; (ii) exhibit vulnerability to profile perturbations; and (iii) are significantly affected by certain key factors that impact their overall believability.

This approach addresses critical shortcomings in existing math problem-solving benchmarks, traditionally used to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of agents. Our paradigm shifts the focus from result-oriented assessments, which often overlook the reasoning process, to a more holistic evaluation that effectively differentiates the cognitive capabilities among models. For example, in our benchmark, GPT-4 demonstrates a performance ten times more accurate than GPT3-5. The significance of this new paradigm lies in its ability to reveal potential cognitive deficiencies in LLMs that current benchmarks, such as GSM8K, fail to uncover due to their saturation and lack of effective differentiation among varying reasoning abilities. Our comprehensive analysis includes several state-of-the-art math models from both open-source and closed-source communities, uncovering fundamental deficiencies in their training and evaluation approaches. This paper not only advocates for a paradigm shift in the assessment of LLMs but also contributes to the ongoing discourse on the trajectory towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By promoting the adoption of meta-reasoning evaluation methods similar to ours, we aim to facilitate a more accurate assessment of the true cognitive abilities of LLMs. et.al.|[2312.17080](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17080)|**[link](https://github.com/dvlab-research/diaggsm8k)**|

Despite their successful implementations, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in low-resource languages. To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs function as rerankers in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems for African languages. Our implementation covers English and four African languages (Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba) and we examine cross-lingual reranking with queries in English and passages in the African languages. Additionally, we analyze and compare the effectiveness of monolingual reranking using both query and document translations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs when leveraging their own generated translations. To get a grasp of the effectiveness of multiple LLMs, our study focuses on the proprietary models RankGPT-4 and RankGPT-3.5, along with the open-source model, RankZephyr. While reranking remains most effective in English, our results reveal that cross-lingual reranking may be competitive with reranking in African languages depending on the multilingual capability of the LLM. et.al.|[2312.16159](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16159)|null|

This paper introduces RoleEval, a bilingual benchmark designed to assess the memorization, utilization, and reasoning capabilities of role knowledge. RoleEval comprises RoleEval-Global (including internationally recognized characters) and RoleEval-Chinese (including characters popular in China), with 6,000 Chinese-English parallel multiple-choice questions focusing on 300 influential people and fictional characters drawn from a variety of domains including celebrities, anime, comics, movies, TV series, games, and fiction. These questions cover basic knowledge and multi-hop reasoning abilities, aiming to systematically probe various aspects such as personal information, relationships, abilities, and experiences of the characters. To maintain high standards, we perform a hybrid quality check process combining automatic and human verification, ensuring that the questions are diverse, challenging, and discriminative.   Our extensive evaluations of RoleEval across various open-source and proprietary large language models, under both the zero- and few-shot settings, reveal insightful findings. Notably, while GPT-4 outperforms other models on RoleEval-Global, Chinese LLMs excel on RoleEval-Chinese, highlighting significant knowledge distribution differences.

|**2023-12-26**|**Can ChatGPT Read Who You Are?**|The interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology, particularly in personality assessment, represents an important emerging area of research. Accurate personality trait estimation is crucial not only for enhancing personalization in human-computer interaction but also for a wide variety of applications ranging from mental health to education. This paper analyzes the capability of a generic chatbot, ChatGPT, to effectively infer personality traits from short texts. We report the results of a comprehensive user study featuring texts written in Czech by a representative population sample of 155 participants. Their self-assessments based on the Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire serve as the ground truth. We compare the personality trait estimations made by ChatGPT against those by human raters and report ChatGPT's competitive performance in inferring personality traits from text. We also uncover a 'positivity bias' in ChatGPT's assessments across all personality dimensions and explore the impact of prompt composition on accuracy. This work contributes to the understanding of AI capabilities in psychological assessment, highlighting both the potential and limitations of using large language models for personality inference. Our research underscores the importance of responsible AI development, considering ethical implications such as privacy, consent, autonomy, and bias in AI applications. et.al.|[2312.16070](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16070)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**A Prompt Learning Framework for Source Code Summarization**|(Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a key role in helping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with the successful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields, software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve code summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction prompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction prompting involves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selecting appropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to have professional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high training costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for code summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can generate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code summarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous prompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to understand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the prompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources. We evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multiple programming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms instruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some base LLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even outperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the training efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of the human evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summaries compared to baselines. et.al.|[2312.16066](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16066)|**[link](https://github.com/wssun/promptcs)**|

Existing research predominantly focuses on heuristic or reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, which often lack transferability across diverse traffic scenarios and suffer from poor interpretability. This paper introduces a novel approach, LLMLight, utilizing large language models (LLMs) for traffic signal control tasks. By leveraging LLMs' impressive generalization and zero-shot reasoning capabilities, LLMLight executes a human-like decision-making process for efficient traffic management. Specifically, the framework begins by composing task descriptions, current traffic conditions, and prior knowledge into a prompt. Subsequently, we utilize LLM's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning ability to identify the next traffic signal phase, ensuring optimal efficiency in the road network. LLMLight achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) or competitive results across five real-world traffic datasets. Notably, LLMLight showcases remarkable generalization, interpretability, and zero-shot reasoning abilities, even without any training for transportation management tasks.

|**2023-12-26**|**RecRanker: Instruction Tuning Large Language Model as Ranker for Top-k Recommendation**|Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and have been extensively deployed across various domains, including recommender systems. Numerous studies have employed specialized \textit{prompts} to harness the in-context learning capabilities intrinsic to LLMs. For example, LLMs are prompted to act as zero-shot rankers for listwise ranking, evaluating candidate items generated by a retrieval model for recommendation. Recent research further uses instruction tuning techniques to align LLM with human preference for more promising recommendations. Despite its potential, current research overlooks the integration of multiple ranking tasks to enhance model performance. Moreover, the signal from the conventional recommendation model is not integrated into the LLM, limiting the current system performance.   In this paper, we introduce RecRanker, tailored for instruction tuning LLM to serve as the \textbf{Ranker} for top-\textit{k} \textbf{Rec}ommendations. Specifically, we introduce importance-aware sampling, clustering-based sampling, and penalty for repetitive sampling for sampling high-quality, representative, and diverse training data. To enhance the prompt, we introduce position shifting strategy to mitigate position bias and augment the prompt with auxiliary information from conventional recommendation models, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of the LLM. Subsequently, we utilize the sampled data to assemble an instruction-tuning dataset with the augmented prompt comprising three distinct ranking tasks: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise rankings. We further propose a hybrid ranking method to enhance the model performance by ensembling these ranking tasks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RecRanker in both direct and sequential recommendation scenarios. et.al.|[2312.16018](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16018)|null|
|**2023-12-26**|**Aligning Large Language Models with Human Preferences through Representation Engineering**|Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for enhancing their utility in terms of helpfulness, truthfulness, safety, harmlessness, and interestingness. Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involves employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation.Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM, and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement.Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance. et.al.|[2312.15997](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15997)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**A Survey of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback**|Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a variant of reinforcement learning (RL) that learns from human feedback instead of relying on an engineered reward function. Building on prior work on the related setting of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), it stands at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. This positioning offers a promising avenue to enhance the performance and adaptability of intelligent systems while also improving the alignment of their objectives with human values. The training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impressively demonstrated this potential in recent years, where RLHF played a decisive role in targeting the model's capabilities toward human objectives. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of RLHF, exploring the intricate dynamics between machine agents and human input. While recent focus has been on RLHF for LLMs, our survey adopts a broader perspective, examining the diverse applications and wide-ranging impact of the technique. We delve into the core principles that underpin RLHF, shedding light on the symbiotic relationship between algorithms and human feedback, and discuss the main research trends in the field. By synthesizing the current landscape of RLHF research, this article aims to provide researchers as well as practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly growing field of research. et.al.|[2312.14925](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14925)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**NPHardEval: Dynamic Benchmark on Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models via Complexity Classes**|Complex reasoning ability is one of the most important features of current LLMs, which has also been leveraged to play an integral role in complex decision-making tasks. Therefore, the investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical: numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, current benchmarks are inadequate in offering a rigorous evaluation of the full extent of reasoning abilities that LLMs are capable of achieving. They are also prone to the risk of overfitting, as these benchmarks, being publicly accessible and static, allow models to potentially tailor their responses to specific benchmark metrics, thereby inflating their performance. Addressing these limitations, our research introduces a new benchmark, named NPHardEval. This benchmark is designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs across a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions, extending up to the NP-Hard complexity class. These questions are meticulously chosen to represent a wide range of complexity class below the NP-hard complexity class, offering a rigorous measure of the reasoning ability of LLMs. Through this study, we shed light on the current state of reasoning in LLMs, providing an objective and rigorous perspective through the comparison of LLMs' performance across complex classes. Moreover, this benchmark is designed with a dynamic update mechanism, where the datapoints are refreshed on a monthly basis. Such regular updates play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of LLMs overfitting to the benchmark, promoting a more accurate and reliable assessment of their reasoning capabilities.

|**2023-12-22**|**Pangu-Agent: A Fine-Tunable Generalist Agent with Structured Reasoning**|A key method for creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents is Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, constructing a standalone RL policy that maps perception to action directly encounters severe problems, chief among them being its lack of generality across multiple tasks and the need for a large amount of training data. The leading cause is that it cannot effectively integrate prior information into the perception-action cycle when devising the policy. Large language models (LLMs) emerged as a fundamental way to incorporate cross-domain knowledge into AI agents but lack crucial learning and adaptation toward specific decision problems. This paper presents a general framework model for integrating and learning structured reasoning into AI agents' policies. Our methodology is motivated by the modularity found in the human brain. The framework utilises the construction of intrinsic and extrinsic functions to add previous understandings of reasoning structures. It also provides the adaptive ability to learn models inside every module or function, consistent with the modular structure of cognitive processes. We describe the framework in-depth and compare it with other AI pipelines and existing frameworks. The paper explores practical applications, covering experiments that show the effectiveness of our method. Our results indicate that AI agents perform and adapt far better when organised reasoning and prior knowledge are embedded. This opens the door to more resilient and general AI agent systems. et.al.|[2312.14878](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14878)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**Robust Knowledge Extraction from Large Language Models using Social Choice Theory**|Large-language models (LLMs) have the potential to support a wide range of applications like conversational agents, creative writing, text improvement, and general query answering. However, they are ill-suited for query answering in high-stake domains like medicine because they generate answers at random and their answers are typically not robust - even the same query can result in different answers when prompted multiple times. In order to improve the robustness of LLM queries, we propose using ranking queries repeatedly and to aggregate the queries using methods from social choice theory. We study ranking queries in diagnostic settings like medical and fault diagnosis and discuss how the Partial Borda Choice function from the literature can be applied to merge multiple query results. We discuss some additional interesting properties in our setting and evaluate the robustness of our approach empirically. et.al.|[2312.14877](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14877)|null|

This paper introduces VIESCORE, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIESCORE leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIESCORE on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIESCORE (GPT4-v) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.3 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIESCORE (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIESCORE achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIESCORE shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks. et.al.|[2312.14867](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14867)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**YAYI 2: Multilingual Open-Source Large Language Models**|As the latest advancements in natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) have achieved human-level language understanding and generation abilities in many real-world tasks, and even have been regarded as a potential path to the artificial general intelligence. To better facilitate research on LLMs, many open-source LLMs, such as Llama 2 and Falcon, have recently been proposed and gained comparable performances to proprietary models. However, these models are primarily designed for English scenarios and exhibit poor performances in Chinese contexts. In this technical report, we propose YAYI 2, including both base and chat models, with 30 billion parameters. YAYI 2 is pre-trained from scratch on a multilingual corpus which contains 2.65 trillion tokens filtered by our pre-training data processing pipeline. The base model is aligned with human values through supervised fine-tuning with millions of instructions and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and CMMLU, consistently demonstrate that the proposed YAYI 2 outperforms other similar sized open-source models. et.al.|[2312.14862](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14862)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**Turbulence: Systematically and Automatically Testing Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models for Code**|We present a method for systematically evaluating the correctness and robustness of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for code generation via a new benchmark, Turbulence. Turbulence consists of a large set of natural language $\textit{question templates}$, each of which is a programming problem, parameterised so that it can be asked in many different forms. Each question template has an associated $\textit{test oracle}$ that judges whether a code solution returned by an LLM is correct. Thus, from a single question template, it is possible to ask an LLM a $\textit{neighbourhood}$ of very similar programming questions, and assess the correctness of the result returned for each question. This allows gaps in an LLM's code generation abilities to be identified, including $\textit{anomalies}$ where the LLM correctly solves $\textit{almost all}$ questions in a neighbourhood but fails for particular parameter instantiations. We present experiments against five LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere and Meta, each at two temperature configurations. Our findings show that, across the board, Turbulence is able to reveal gaps in LLM reasoning ability. This goes beyond merely highlighting that LLMs sometimes produce wrong code (which is no surprise): by systematically identifying cases where LLMs are able to solve some problems in a neighbourhood but do not manage to generalise to solve the whole neighbourhood, our method is effective at highlighting $\textit{robustness}$ issues. We present data and examples that shed light on the kinds of mistakes that LLMs make when they return incorrect code results. et.al.|[2312.14856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14856)|null|
|**2023-12-22**|**Plan, Posture and Go: Towards Open-World Text-to-Motion Generation**|Conventional text-to-motion generation methods are usually trained on limited text-motion pairs, making them hard to generalize to open-world scenarios. Some works use the CLIP model to align the motion space and the text space, aiming to enable motion generation from natural language motion descriptions. However, they are still constrained to generate limited and unrealistic in-place motions. To address these issues, we present a divide-and-conquer framework named PRO-Motion, which consists of three modules as motion planner, posture-diffuser and go-diffuser. The motion planner instructs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sequence of scripts describing the key postures in the target motion. Differing from natural languages, the scripts can describe all possible postures following very simple text templates. This significantly reduces the complexity of posture-diffuser, which transforms a script to a posture, paving the way for open-world generation. Finally, go-diffuser, implemented as another diffusion model, estimates whole-body translations and rotations for all postures, resulting in realistic motions. Experimental results have shown the superiority of our method with other counterparts, and demonstrated its capability of generating diverse and realistic motions from complex open-world prompts such as "Experiencing a profound sense of joy".

|**2023-12-22**|**Use large language models to promote equity**|Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven an explosion of interest about their societal impacts. Much of the discourse around how they will impact social equity has been cautionary or negative, focusing on questions like "how might LLMs be biased and how would we mitigate those biases?" This is a vital discussion: the ways in which AI generally, and LLMs specifically, can entrench biases have been well-documented. But equally vital, and much less discussed, is the more opportunity-focused counterpoint: "what promising applications do LLMs enable that could promote equity?" If LLMs are to enable a more equitable world, it is not enough just to play defense against their biases and failure modes. We must also go on offense, applying them positively to equity-enhancing use cases to increase opportunities for underserved groups and reduce societal discrimination. There are many choices which determine the impact of AI, and a fundamental choice very early in the pipeline is the problems we choose to apply it to. If we focus only later in the pipeline -- making LLMs marginally more fair as they facilitate use cases which intrinsically entrench power -- we will miss an important opportunity to guide them to equitable impacts. Here, we highlight the emerging potential of LLMs to promote equity by presenting four newly possible, promising research directions, while keeping risks and cautionary points in clear view. et.al.|[2312.14804](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14804)|null|

|**2023-12-21**|**LiDAR-LLM: Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for 3D LiDAR Understanding**|Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in instruction following and 2D image understanding. While these models are powerful, they have not yet been developed to comprehend the more challenging 3D physical scenes, especially when it comes to the sparse outdoor LiDAR data. In this paper, we introduce LiDAR-LLM, which takes raw LiDAR data as input and harnesses the remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs to gain a comprehensive understanding of outdoor 3D scenes. The central insight of our LiDAR-LLM is the reformulation of 3D outdoor scene cognition as a language modeling problem, encompassing tasks such as 3D captioning, 3D grounding, 3D question answering, etc. Specifically, due to the scarcity of 3D LiDAR-text pairing data, we introduce a three-stage training strategy and generate relevant datasets, progressively aligning the 3D modality with the language embedding space of LLM. Furthermore, we design a View-Aware Transformer (VAT) to connect the 3D encoder with the LLM, which effectively bridges the modality gap and enhances the LLM's spatial orientation comprehension of visual features. Our experiments show that LiDAR-LLM possesses favorable capabilities to comprehend various instructions regarding 3D scenes and engage in complex spatial reasoning. LiDAR-LLM attains a 40.9 BLEU-1 on the 3D captioning task and achieves a 63.1\% classification accuracy and a 14.3\% BEV mIoU on the 3D grounding task.

To this end, we establish a simple, yet strong model that adopts a Transformer-based architecture with all texts as queries, iteratively attending to the visual features, to infer the optimal timestamp. We conduct thorough experiments to investigate: (i) the effect of upgrading ASR systems to reduce errors from speech recognition, (ii) the effect of various visual-textual backbones, ranging from CLIP to S3D, to the more recent InternVideo, (iii) the effect of transforming noisy ASR transcripts into descriptive steps by prompting a large language model (LLM), to summarize the core activities within the ASR transcript as a new training dataset. As a result, our proposed simple model demonstrates superior performance on both narration alignment and procedural step grounding tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on three public benchmarks, namely, 9.3% on HT-Step, 3.4% on HTM-Align and 4.7% on CrossTask. We believe the proposed model and dataset with descriptive steps can be treated as a strong baseline for future research in temporal video-text alignment.

We define human likeness as `not distinguishable from human comments', approximated by the difficulty of automatic classification between human and GPT comments. We analyze human likeness across multiple prompting techniques. In particular, we utilize zero-shot, few-shot and context prompts, for two generated personas. We found that our fine-tuned BERT models can easily distinguish human-written comments from GPT-3.5 generated comments, with none of the used prompting methods performing noticeably better. We further analyzed that human comments consistently showed higher lexical diversity than GPT-generated comments.

Specifically, a Large Language Model (LLM) transforms text into expressive representation. After the text is extracted into columnar form, it can then be queried via a text-to-SQL Semantic Parser, with an LLM converting natural language into SQL. Where desired, such conversation may be effected by a multi-step reasoning conversational agent. We validate our approach via a proprietary question/answer data set, concluding that dIR makes a whole new class of queries on free text possible when compared to traditionally fine-tuned dense-embedding-model-based Information Retrieval (IR) and SQL-based Knowledge Bases (KB). For sufficiently complex queries, dIR can succeed where no other method stands a chance. et.al.|[2312.13264](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13264)|null|

|**2023-12-20**|**LlaMaVAE: Guiding Large Language Model Generation via Continuous Latent Sentence Spaces**|Deep generative neural networks, such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), offer an opportunity to better understand and control language models from the perspective of sentence-level latent spaces. To combine the controllability of VAE latent spaces with the state-of-the-art performance of recent large language models (LLMs), we present in this work LlaMaVAE, which combines expressive encoder and decoder models (sentenceT5 and LlaMA) with a VAE architecture, aiming to provide better text generation control to LLMs. In addition, to conditionally guide the VAE generation, we investigate a new approach based on flow-based invertible neural networks (INNs) named Invertible CVAE. Experimental results reveal that LlaMaVAE can outperform the previous state-of-the-art VAE language model, Optimus, across various tasks, including language modelling, semantic textual similarity and definition modelling. Qualitative analysis on interpolation and traversal experiments also indicates an increased degree of semantic clustering and geometric consistency, which enables better generation control. et.al.|[2312.13208](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13208)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Contextual Code Switching for Machine Translation using Language Models**|Large language models (LLMs) have exerted a considerable impact on diverse language-related tasks in recent years. Their demonstrated state-of-the-art performance is achieved through methodologies such as zero-shot or few-shot prompting. These models undergo training on extensive datasets that encompass segments of the Internet and subsequently undergo fine-tuning tailored to specific tasks. Notably, they exhibit proficiency in tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and creative writing, even in the absence of explicit training for those particular tasks. While they have shown substantial improvement in the multilingual tasks their performance in the code switching, especially for machine translation remains relatively uncharted. In this paper, we present an extensive study on the code switching task specifically for the machine translation task comparing multiple LLMs. Our results indicate that despite the LLMs having promising results in the certain tasks, the models with relatively lesser complexity outperform the multilingual large language models in the machine translation task. We posit that the efficacy of multilingual large language models in contextual code switching is constrained by their training methodologies. In contrast, relatively smaller models, when trained and fine-tuned on bespoke datasets, may yield superior results in comparison to the majority of multilingual models. et.al.|[2312.13179](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13179)|null|

However, these continuous encounters are diverse and complex, posing challenges to their study and experimentation. Researchers have been able to isolate environmental features and study their effect on human perception and behavior. However, the research attempts to replicate and study human behaviors with proxies, such as by integrating virtual mediums and interviews, have been inconsistent. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been unveiled as capable of contextual understanding and semantic reasoning. These models have been trained on large amounts of text and have evolved to mimic believable human behavior. This study explores the current advancements in Generative agents powered by LLMs with the help of perceptual experiments. The experiment employs Generative agents to interact with the urban environments using street view images to plan their journey toward specific goals. The agents are given virtual personalities, which make them distinguishable. They are also provided a memory database to store their thoughts and essential visual information and retrieve it when needed to plan their movement. Since LLMs do not possess embodiment, nor have access to the visual realm, and lack a sense of motion or direction, we designed movement and visual modules that help agents gain an overall understanding of surroundings. The agents are further employed to rate the surroundings they encounter based on their perceived sense of safety and liveliness. As these agents store details in their memory, we query the findings to get details regarding their thought processes. Overall, this study experiments with current AI developments and their potential in simulated human behavior in urban environments. et.al.|[2312.13126](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13126)|null|

Existing works leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) or LLM-based AI agents have shown capabilities in automating tasks on Android and Web platforms. However, these tasks are primarily aimed at simple device usage and entertainment operations. This paper presents a novel benchmark, AssistGUI, to evaluate whether models are capable of manipulating the mouse and keyboard on the Windows platform in response to user-requested tasks. We carefully collected a set of 100 tasks from nine widely-used software applications, such as, After Effects and MS Word, each accompanied by the necessary project files for better evaluation. Moreover, we propose an advanced Actor-Critic Embodied Agent framework, which incorporates a sophisticated GUI parser driven by an LLM-agent and an enhanced reasoning mechanism adept at handling lengthy procedural tasks. Our experimental results reveal that our GUI Parser and Reasoning mechanism outshine existing methods in performance. Nevertheless, the potential remains substantial, with the best model attaining only a 46% success rate on our benchmark. We conclude with a thorough analysis of the current methods' limitations, setting the stage for future breakthroughs in this domain. et.al.|[2312.13108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13108)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Exploring Multimodal Large Language Models for Radiology Report Error-checking**|This paper proposes one of the first clinical applications of multimodal large language models (LLMs) as an assistant for radiologists to check errors in their reports. We created an evaluation dataset from two real-world radiology datasets (MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray), with 1,000 subsampled reports each. A subset of original reports was modified to contain synthetic errors by introducing various type of mistakes. The evaluation contained two difficulty levels: SIMPLE for binary error-checking and COMPLEX for identifying error types. LLaVA (Large Language and Visual Assistant) variant models, including our instruction-tuned model, were used for the evaluation. Additionally, a domain expert evaluation was conducted on a small test set. At the SIMPLE level, the LLaVA v1.5 model outperformed other publicly available models. Instruction tuning significantly enhanced performance by 47.4% and 25.4% on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray data, respectively. The model also surpassed the domain experts accuracy in the MIMIC-CXR dataset by 1.67%. Notably, among the subsets (N=21) of the test set where a clinician did not achieve the correct conclusion, the LLaVA ensemble mode correctly identified 71.4% of these cases. This study marks a promising step toward utilizing multi-modal LLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy in radiology. The ensemble model demonstrated comparable performance to clinicians, even capturing errors overlooked by humans. Nevertheless, future work is needed to improve the model ability to identify the types of inconsistency. et.al.|[2312.13103](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13103)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**In Generative AI we Trust: Can Chatbots Effectively Verify Political Information?**|This article presents a comparative analysis of the ability of two large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, ChatGPT and Bing Chat, recently rebranded to Microsoft Copilot, to detect veracity of political information. We use AI auditing methodology to investigate how chatbots evaluate true, false, and borderline statements on five topics: COVID-19, Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Holocaust, climate change, and LGBTQ+ related debates. We compare how the chatbots perform in high- and low-resource languages by using prompts in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. Furthermore, we explore the ability of chatbots to evaluate statements according to political communication concepts of disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy theory, using definition-oriented prompts. We also systematically test how such evaluations are influenced by source bias which we model by attributing specific claims to various political and social actors. The results show high performance of ChatGPT for the baseline veracity evaluation task, with 72 percent of the cases evaluated correctly on average across languages without pre-training. Bing Chat performed worse with a 67 percent accuracy. We observe significant disparities in how chatbots evaluate prompts in high- and low-resource languages and how they adapt their evaluations to political communication concepts with ChatGPT providing more nuanced outputs than Bing Chat. Finally, we find that for some veracity detection-related tasks, the performance of chatbots varied depending on the topic of the statement or the source to which it is attributed. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based chatbots in tackling different forms of false information in online environments, but also points to the substantial variation in terms of how such potential is realized due to specific factors, such as language of the prompt or the topic. et.al.|[2312.13096](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13096)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Lampr: Boosting the Effectiveness of Language-Generic Program Reduction via Large Language Models**|Program reduction is a prevalent technique to facilitate compilers' debugging by automatically minimizing bug-triggering programs. Existing program reduction techniques are either generic across languages (e.g., Perses and Vulcan) or specifically customized for one certain language by employing language-specific features, like C-Reduce. However, striking the balance between generality across multiple programming languages and specificity to individual languages in program reduction is yet to be explored.   This paper proposes Lampr, the first technique utilizing LLMs to perform language-specific program reduction for multiple languages. The core insight is to utilize both the language-generic syntax level program reduction (e.g., Perses) and the language-specific semantic level program transformations learned by LLMs. Alternately, language-generic program reducers efficiently reduce programs into 1-tree-minimality, which is small enough to be manageable for LLMs; LLMs effectively transform programs via the learned semantics to expose new reduction opportunities for the language-generic program reducers to further reduce the programs.   Our extensive evaluation on 50 benchmarks across three languages (C, Rust, and JavaScript) has highlighted Lampr's practicality and superiority over Vulcan, the state-of-the-art language-generic program reducer. For effectiveness, Lampr surpasses Vulcan by producing 24.93\%, 4.47\%, and 11.71\% smaller programs on benchmarks in C, Rust and JavaScript. Moreover, Lampr and Vulcan have demonstrated their potential to complement each other. By using Vulcan on Lampr's output for C programs, we achieve program sizes comparable to those reduced by C-Reduce. For efficiency, Lampr takes 10.77\%, 34.88\%, 36.96\% less time than Vulcan to finish all benchmarks in C, Rust and JavaScript, separately. et.al.|[2312.13064](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13064)|null|
|**2023-12-20**|**Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing**|Knowledge represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite often incorrect and can also become obsolete over time. Updating knowledge via fine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so knowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative to inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has been considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively focuses on the monolingual setting, typically in English. However, what happens if the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query the LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual knowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) to update new knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can perform model-agnostic knowledge editing in multilingual settings. ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with prompts. Our experimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods by a significant margin and is the first KE method to work in a multilingual setting. We provide our multilingual knowledge editing dataset (MzsRE) in 12 languages, which along with code, and additional project information is available at https://github.com/Vicky-Wil/ReMaKE. et.al.|[2312.13040](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13040)|**[link](https://github.com/vicky-wil/remake)**|

Early Explorations of Gemini in Visual Expertise**|The surge of interest towards Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), e.g., GPT-4V(ision) from OpenAI, has marked a significant trend in both academia and industry. They endow Large Language Models (LLMs) with powerful capabilities in visual understanding, enabling them to tackle diverse multi-modal tasks. Very recently, Google released Gemini, its newest and most capable MLLM built from the ground up for multi-modality. In light of the superior reasoning capabilities, can Gemini challenge GPT-4V's leading position in multi-modal learning? In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of Gemini Pro's visual understanding proficiency, which comprehensively covers four domains: fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision tasks, and various expert capacities. We compare Gemini Pro with the state-of-the-art GPT-4V to evaluate its upper limits, along with the latest open-sourced MLLM, Sphinx, which reveals the gap between manual efforts and black-box systems. The qualitative samples indicate that, while GPT-4V and Gemini showcase different answering styles and preferences, they can exhibit comparable visual reasoning capabilities, and Sphinx still trails behind them concerning domain generalizability. Specifically, GPT-4V tends to elaborate detailed explanations and intermediate steps, and Gemini prefers to output a direct and concise answer. The quantitative evaluation on the popular MME benchmark also demonstrates the potential of Gemini to be a strong challenger to GPT-4V. Our early investigation of Gemini also observes some common issues of MLLMs, indicating that there still remains a considerable distance towards artificial general intelligence.

|**2023-12-19**|**Jack of All Tasks, Master of Many: Designing General-purpose Coarse-to-Fine Vision-Language Model**|The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process visual inputs has given rise to general-purpose vision systems, unifying various vision-language (VL) tasks by instruction tuning. However, due to the enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain, existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a single framework. In this work, we introduce VistaLLM, a powerful visual system that addresses coarse- and fine-grained VL tasks over single and multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from numerous images. Moreover, VistaLLM employs a gradient-aware adaptive sampling technique to represent binary segmentation masks as sequences, significantly improving over previously used uniform sampling. To bolster the desired capability of VistaLLM, we curate CoinIt, a comprehensive coarse-to-fine instruction tuning dataset with 6.8M samples. We also address the lack of multi-image grounding datasets by introducing a novel task, AttCoSeg (Attribute-level Co-Segmentation), which boosts the model's reasoning and grounding capability over multiple input images. Extensive experiments on a wide range of V- and VL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VistaLLM by achieving consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across all downstream tasks.

Many mathematical reasoning problems, however, contain both text and image. With the ever-increasing adoption of vision language models (VLMs), understanding their reasoning abilities for such problems is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs along various axes through the lens of geometry problems. We procedurally create a synthetic dataset of geometry questions with controllable difficulty levels along multiple axes, thus enabling a systematic evaluation. The empirical results obtained using our benchmark for state-of-the-art VLMs indicate that these models are not as capable in subjects like geometry (and, by generalization, other topics requiring similar reasoning) as suggested by previous benchmarks. This is made especially clear by the construction of our benchmark at various depth levels, since solving higher-depth problems requires long chains of reasoning rather than additional memorized knowledge.

However, the enormous size and computational demands of these models pose significant challenges for adapting them to specific downstream tasks, especially in environments with limited computational resources.

|**2023-12-19**|**Curated LLM: Synergy of LLMs and Data Curation for tabular augmentation in ultra low-data regimes**|Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet crucial problem. This challenge is pronounced in low-to-middle income countries where access to large datasets is often limited or even absent. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this technical challenge, we introduce CLLM, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. While diverse, not all the data generated by LLMs will help increase utility for a downstream task, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation process, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLMs in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. We further show our curation mechanism improves the downstream performance for all generators, including LLMs. Additionally, we provide insights and understanding into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets. CLLM paves the way for wider usage of ML in data scarce domains and regions, by allying the strengths of LLMs with a robust data-centric approach. et.al.|[2312.12112](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12112)|null|

|**2023-12-19**|**Active Preference Inference using Language Models and Probabilistic Reasoning**|Actively inferring user preferences, for example by asking good questions, is important for any human-facing decision-making system. Active inference allows such systems to adapt and personalize themselves to nuanced individual preferences. To enable this ability for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), one may prompt them to ask users questions to infer their preferences, transforming the language models into more robust, interactive systems. However, out of the box, these models are not efficient at extracting preferences: the questions they generate are not informative, requiring a high number of user interactions and impeding the usability of the downstream system. In this work, we introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. Our algorithm uses a probabilistic model whose conditional distributions are defined by prompting an LLM, and returns questions that optimize expected entropy and expected model change. Results in a simplified interactive web shopping setting with real product items show that an LLM equipped with our entropy reduction algorithm outperforms baselines with the same underlying LLM on task performance while using fewer user interactions. et.al.|[2312.12009](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12009)|null|

Recently, prompt tuning has become a popular solution. When adapting the vision-language models, researchers freeze the parameters in the backbone and only design and tune the prompts. On the one hand, the delicate design of prompt tuning exhibits strong performance. On the other hand, complicated structures and update rules largely increase the computation and storage cost. Motivated by the observation that the evolution pattern of the generalization capability in visual-language models aligns harmoniously with the trend of rank variations in the prompt matrix during adaptation, we design a new type of prompt, Re-parameterized Low-rank Prompt (RLP), for both efficient and effective adaptation. Our method could largely reduce the number of tunable parameters and storage space, which is quite beneficial in resource-limited scenarios. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the superiority of RLP. In particular, RLP shows comparable or even stronger performance than the latest state-of-the-art methods with an extremely small number of parameters. On a series of tasks over 11 datasets, RLP significantly increases the average downstream accuracy of classic prompt tuning by up to 5.25% using merely 0.5K parameters. et.al.|[2312.10813](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10813)|null|

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in synthesizing computer programs based on a natural language prompt, mitigating the gap between natural language and structured programs. Our paper focuses on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for semantic parsing tasks, addressing the following three key research questions: 1) How can LLMs be effectively utilized for semantic parsing tasks? 2) What defines an effective prompt? and 3) How can LLM overcome the length constraint and streamline prompt design by including all examples as prompts? We introduce k Nearest Neighbor In-Context Learning(kNN-ICL), which simplifies prompt engineering by allowing it to be built on top of any design strategy while providing access to all demo examples. Extensive experiments show that: 1)Simple ICL without kNN search can achieve a comparable performance with strong supervised models on the TOP tasks, and 2) kNN-ICL significantly improves the comprehension of complex requests by seamlessly integrating ICL with a nearest-neighbor approach.

These attacks can allow malicious users to exploit the models, making the case for effective jailbreak detection mechanisms an essential aspect of maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of LLM-based applications. However, existing detection works on jailbreak attacks have limitations. Existing post-query-based strategies require target domain knowledge, and pre-query-based methods mainly focus on text-level attacks and fail to meet the increasingly complex multi-modal security requirements placed upon contemporary LLMs. This gap underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to safeguarding these influential systems.   In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities. Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries. Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response. This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection. Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula. To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities. The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%. et.al.|[2312.10766](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10766)|null|
|**2023-12-17**|**M3DBench: Let's Instruct Large Models with Multi-modal 3D Prompts**|Recently, 3D understanding has become popular to facilitate autonomous agents to perform further decisionmaking. However, existing 3D datasets and methods are often limited to specific tasks. On the other hand, recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) have demonstrated exceptional general language and imagery tasking performance. Therefore, it is interesting to unlock MLM's potential to be 3D generalist for wider tasks. However, current MLMs' research has been less focused on 3D tasks due to a lack of large-scale 3D instruction-following datasets. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive 3D instructionfollowing dataset called M3DBench, which possesses the following characteristics: 1) It supports general multimodal instructions interleaved with text, images, 3D objects, and other visual prompts. 2) It unifies diverse 3D tasks at both region and scene levels, covering a variety of fundamental abilities in real-world 3D environments. 3) It is a large-scale 3D instruction-following dataset with over 320k instruction-response pairs. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark for assessing the performance of large models in understanding multi-modal 3D prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and baseline, supporting general 3D-centric tasks, which can inspire future research. et.al.|[2312.10763](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10763)|**[link](https://github.com/OpenM3D/M3DBench)**|

In recent years, vaccination has been a key step in countering the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many people are skeptical about the use of vaccines for various reasons, including the politics involved, the potential side effects of vaccines, etc. The goal in this task is to build an effective multi-label classifier to label a social media post (particularly, a tweet) according to the specific concern(s) towards vaccines as expressed by the author of the post. We tried three different models-(a) Supervised BERT-large-uncased, (b) Supervised HateXplain model, and (c) Zero-Shot GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The Supervised BERT-large-uncased model performed best in our case. We achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.66, a Jaccard similarity score of 0.66, and received the sixth rank among other submissions.

|**2023-12-17**|**Knowledge Trees: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees on Knowledge Neurons as Probing Classifier**|To understand how well a large language model captures certain semantic or syntactic features, researchers typically apply probing classifiers. However, the accuracy of these classifiers is critical for the correct interpretation of the results. If a probing classifier exhibits low accuracy, this may be due either to the fact that the language model does not capture the property under investigation, or to shortcomings in the classifier itself, which is unable to adequately capture the characteristics encoded in the internal representations of the model. Consequently, for more effective diagnosis, it is necessary to use the most accurate classifiers possible for a particular type of task. Logistic regression on the output representation of the transformer neural network layer is most often used to probing the syntactic properties of the language model.   We show that using gradient boosting decision trees at the Knowledge Neuron layer, i.e., at the hidden layer of the feed-forward network of the transformer as a probing classifier for recognizing parts of a sentence is more advantageous than using logistic regression on the output representations of the transformer layer. This approach is also preferable to many other methods. The gain in error rate, depending on the preset, ranges from 9-54% et.al.|[2312.10746](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10746)|null|
|**2023-12-17**|**A Unified Framework for Multi-Domain CTR Prediction via Large Language Models**|Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them. Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``). In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency. et.al.|[2312.10743](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10743)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Osprey: Pixel Understanding with Visual Instruction Tuning**|Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding, falling short of achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at the pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Especially, Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics.

|**2023-12-15**|**Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery**|We show that existing unsupervised methods on large language model (LLM) activations do not discover knowledge -- instead they seem to discover whatever feature of the activations is most prominent. The idea behind unsupervised knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure, which can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation method, contrast-consistent search (Burns et al. - arXiv:2212.03827). We then present a series of experiments showing settings in which unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we hypothesise that the identification issues explored here, e.g. distinguishing a model's knowledge from that of a simulated character's, will persist for future unsupervised methods. et.al.|[2312.10029](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10029)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with Large Language Models**|High-quality conversational datasets are essential for developing AI models that can communicate with users. One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user's character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat. We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations. et.al.|[2312.10007](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10007)|**[link](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat)**|

Several systems have combined knowledge retrieval with a large language model (LLM) to answer such questions. These systems, however, suffer from various failure cases, and we cannot directly train them end-to-end to fix such failures, as interaction with external knowledge is non-differentiable. To address these deficiencies, we define a ReAct-style LLM agent with the ability to reason and act upon external knowledge. We further refine the agent through a ReST-like method that iteratively trains on previous trajectories, employing growing-batch reinforcement learning with AI feedback for continuous self-improvement and self-distillation. Starting from a prompted large model and after just two iterations of the algorithm, we can produce a fine-tuned small model that achieves comparable performance on challenging compositional question-answering benchmarks with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. et.al.|[2312.10003](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10003)|null|

With its exceptional capacity to capture complex contextual relationships, the LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) family represents a novel advancement in the field of natural language processing by releasing foundational models designed to improve the natural language understanding abilities of the transformer architecture thanks to their large amount of trainable parameters (7, 13, and 70 billion parameters). In many natural language understanding tasks, these models obtain the same performances as private company models such as OpenAI Chat-GPT with the advantage to make publicly available weights and code for research and commercial uses. In this work, we investigate the possibility of Language Adaptation for LLaMA models, explicitly focusing on addressing the challenge of Italian Language coverage. Adopting an open science approach, we explore various tuning approaches to ensure a high-quality text generated in Italian suitable for common tasks in this underrepresented language in the original models' datasets. We aim to release effective text generation models with strong linguistic properties for many tasks that seem challenging using multilingual or general-purpose LLMs. By leveraging an open science philosophy, this study contributes to Language Adaptation strategies for the Italian language by introducing the novel LLaMAntino family of Italian LLMs. et.al.|[2312.09993](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09993)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**The Art of Balancing: Revolutionizing Mixture of Experts for Maintaining World Knowledge in Language Model Alignment**|Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to align with human instructions and enhance their capabilities in downstream tasks. When the models are required to align with a broader range of downstream tasks, or there is a desire to notably improve the performance on a specific task, a substantial increase in fine-tuning data often emerges as the solution. However, we find that large-scale increases in instruction data can disrupt the world knowledge previously stored in the LLMs, i.e., world knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we introduce LoRAMoE to address above challenge. The LoRAMoE is a plugin version of Mixture of Experts (MoE). The plugin-form ensures the integrity of world knowledge by freezing the backbone model during the training phase. And we propose the use of localized balancing constraints to coordinate parts of experts for task utilization, meanwhile enables other experts to to fully leverage the world knowledge stored in the models. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRAMoE can reasonly coordinate experts based on data type during inference, and even dramatically increasing instruction data does not result in knowledge forgetting. Moreover, LoRAMoE provides additional benefits for the performance of downstream tasks, indicating the potential of our approach for multi-task learning. et.al.|[2312.09979](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09979)|null|
|**2023-12-15**|**Distilling Large Language Models for Matching Patients to Clinical Trials**|The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for their adoption in the high-stakes domain of healthcare. Specifically, the application of LLMs in patient-trial matching, which involves assessing patient eligibility against clinical trial's nuanced inclusion and exclusion criteria, has shown promise. Recent research has shown that GPT-3.5, a widely recognized LLM developed by OpenAI, can outperform existing methods with minimal 'variable engineering' by simply comparing clinical trial information against patient summaries. However, there are significant challenges associated with using closed-source proprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5 in practical healthcare applications, such as cost, privacy and reproducibility concerns. To address these issues, this study presents the first systematic examination of the efficacy of both proprietary (GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) and open-source LLMs (LLAMA 7B,13B, and 70B) for the task of patient-trial matching. Employing a multifaceted evaluation framework, we conducted extensive automated and human-centric assessments coupled with a detailed error analysis for each model. To enhance the adaptability of open-source LLMs, we have created a specialized synthetic dataset utilizing GPT-4, enabling effective fine-tuning under constrained data conditions. Our findings reveal that open-source LLMs, when fine-tuned on this limited and synthetic dataset, demonstrate performance parity with their proprietary counterparts. This presents a massive opportunity for their deployment in real-world healthcare applications. To foster further research and applications in this field, we release both the annotated evaluation dataset along with the fine-tuned LLM -- Trial-LLAMA -- for public use. et.al.|[2312.09958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09958)|null|

Data discovery predominantly happens via search on a data portal or the web, followed by assessment of the dataset to ensure it is fit for the intended purpose. The ability of conversational generative AI (CGAI) to support recommendations with reasoning implies it can suggest datasets to users, explain why it has done so, and provide information akin to documentation regarding the dataset in order to support a use decision. We hold 3 workshops with data users and find that, despite limitations around web capabilities, CGAIs are able to suggest relevant datasets and provide many of the required sensemaking activities, as well as support dataset analysis and manipulation. However, CGAIs may also suggest fictional datasets, and perform inaccurate analysis.

This trend has sparked significant discourse centered around the ever-increasing need for LLM-based AI systems to function among humans as part of human society, sharing human values, especially as these systems are deployed in high-stakes settings (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, etc.). Towards this end, neurosymbolic AI systems are attractive due to their potential to enable easy-to-understand and interpretable interfaces for facilitating value-based decision-making, by leveraging explicit representations of shared values. In this paper, we introduce substantial extensions to Khaneman's System one/two framework and propose a neurosymbolic computational framework called Value-Inspired AI (VAI). It outlines the crucial components essential for the robust and practical implementation of VAI systems, aiming to represent and integrate various dimensions of human values.

|**2023-12-15**|**Red AI? Inconsistent Responses from GPT3.5 Models on Political Issues in the US and China**|The rising popularity of ChatGPT and other AI-powered large language models (LLMs) has led to increasing studies highlighting their susceptibility to mistakes and biases. However, most of these studies focus on models trained on English texts. Taking an innovative approach, this study investigates political biases in GPT's multilingual models. We posed the same question about high-profile political issues in the United States and China to GPT in both English and simplified Chinese, and our analysis of the bilingual responses revealed that GPT's bilingual models' political "knowledge" (content) and the political "attitude" (sentiment) are significantly more inconsistent on political issues in China. The simplified Chinese GPT models not only tended to provide pro-China information but also presented the least negative sentiment towards China's problems, whereas the English GPT was significantly more negative towards China. This disparity may stem from Chinese state censorship and US-China geopolitical tensions, which influence the training corpora of GPT bilingual models. Moreover, both Chinese and English models tended to be less critical towards the issues of "their own" represented by the language used, than the issues of "the other." This suggests that GPT multilingual models could potentially develop a "political identity" and an associated sentiment bias based on their training language. We discussed the implications of our findings for information transmission and communication in an increasingly divided world. et.al.|[2312.09917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09917)|null|

In this work, we delve into the potential of large language models (LLMs) in autonomous driving (AD). We introduce DriveMLM, an LLM-based AD framework that can perform close-loop autonomous driving in realistic simulators. To this end, (1) we bridge the gap between the language decisions and the vehicle control commands by standardizing the decision states according to the off-the-shelf motion planning module. (2) We employ a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) to model the behavior planning module of a module AD system, which uses driving rules, user commands, and inputs from various sensors (e.g., camera, lidar) as input and makes driving decisions and provide explanations; This model can plug-and-play in existing AD systems such as Apollo for close-loop driving.

We conduct extensive experiments and show that our model achieves 76.1 driving score on the CARLA Town05 Long, and surpasses the Apollo baseline by 4.7 points under the same settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.

The challenge in exploration efficiency makes it difficult to effectively learn complex tasks in Minecraft. To address this, this paper introduces an advanced learning system, named Auto MC-Reward, that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design dense reward functions, thereby enhancing the learning efficiency. Auto MC-Reward consists of three important components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environment information and task descriptions, the Reward Designer first design the reward function by coding an executable Python function with predefined observation inputs. Then, our Reward Critic will be responsible for verifying the code, checking whether the code is self-consistent and free of syntax and semantic errors. Further, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes possible failure causes and provides refinement suggestions according to collected trajectories. In the next round, Reward Designer will take further refine and iterate the dense reward function based on feedback. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the success rate and learning efficiency of our agents in complex tasks in Minecraft, such as obtaining diamond with the efficient ability to avoid lava, and efficiently explore trees and animals that are sparse on the plains biome. et.al.|[2312.09238](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09238)|null|

Existing vision-language models can describe images in natural languages, answer visual-related questions, or perform complex reasoning about the image. However, it is yet unclear how localization tasks, such as word grounding or referring localization, can be performed using large language models. In this work, we aim to develop a vision-language model that can take locations, for example, a set of points or boxes, as either inputs or outputs. When taking locations as inputs, the model performs location-conditioned captioning, which generates captions for the indicated object or region. When generating locations as outputs, our model regresses pixel coordinates for each output word generated by the language model, and thus performs dense word grounding. Our model is pre-trained on the Localized Narrative dataset, which contains pixel-word-aligned captioning from human attention. We show our model can be applied to various location-aware vision-language tasks, including referring localization, location-conditioned captioning, and dense object captioning, archiving state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO and Visual Genome.

For example, successor heads increment 'Monday' into 'Tuesday'. We explain the successor head behavior with an approach rooted in mechanistic interpretability, the field that aims to explain how models complete tasks in human-understandable terms. Existing research in this area has found interpretable language model components in small toy models. However, results in toy models have not yet led to insights that explain the internals of frontier models and little is currently understood about the internal operations of large language models. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of successor heads in large language models (LLMs) and find that they implement abstract representations that are common to different architectures. They form in LLMs with as few as 31 million parameters, and at least as many as 12 billion parameters, such as GPT-2, Pythia, and Llama-2. We find a set of 'mod-10 features' that underlie how successor heads increment in LLMs across different architectures and sizes. We perform vector arithmetic with these features to edit head behavior and provide insights into numeric representations within LLMs. Additionally, we study the behavior of successor heads on natural language data, identifying interpretable polysemanticity in a Pythia successor head. et.al.|[2312.09230](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09230)|null|

We rely on LLMs' remarkable linguistic fluency to elicit ideological scales of both legislators and text, which accord closely to established methods and our own judgement. A key aspect of our approach is that we elicit such scores directly, instructing the LLM to furnish numeric scores itself. This approach affords a great deal of flexibility, which we showcase through a variety of different case studies.

Event-based networks on neuromorphic devices offer a potential way to reduce energy consumption for inference significantly. However, to date, most event-based networks that can run on neuromorphic hardware, including spiking neural networks (SNNs), have not achieved task performance even on par with LSTM models for language modeling. As a result, language modeling on neuromorphic devices has seemed a distant prospect.

SpiNNaker 2 is a many-core neuromorphic chip designed for large-scale asynchronous processing, while the EGRU is architected to leverage such hardware efficiently while maintaining competitive task performance. This implementation marks the first time a neuromorphic language model matches LSTMs, setting the stage for taking task performance to the level of large language models. We also demonstrate results on a gesture recognition task based on inputs from a DVS camera.

Holodeck leverages a large language model (GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like and uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene with diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects correctly, we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between objects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-scale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually designed procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can produce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an exciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI, training agents to navigate in novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data, which is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied agents. et.al.|[2312.09067](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09067)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**An Invitation to Deep Reinforcement Learning**|Training a deep neural network to maximize a target objective has become the standard recipe for successful machine learning over the last decade. These networks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is differentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case. Common objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised learning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses, leading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for optimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in recent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human feedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL techniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is, however, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well as the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an alternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks. Rather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning as a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to non-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems. Assuming only basic knowledge of supervised learning, the reader will be able to understand state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) after reading this tutorial. et.al.|[2312.08365](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08365)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**Distributed Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Language Models Over The Internet**|Large language models (LLMs) are useful in many NLP tasks and become more capable with size, with the best open-source models having over 50 billion parameters. However, using these 50B+ models requires high-end hardware, making them inaccessible to most researchers. In this work, we investigate methods for cost-efficient inference and fine-tuning of LLMs, comparing local and distributed strategies. We observe that a large enough model (50B+) can run efficiently even on geodistributed devices in a consumer-grade network. This could allow running LLM efficiently by pooling together idle compute resources of multiple research groups and volunteers. We address two open problems: (1) how to perform inference and fine-tuning reliably if any device can disconnect abruptly and (2) how to partition LLMs between devices with uneven hardware, joining and leaving at will. In order to do that, we develop special fault-tolerant inference algorithms and load-balancing protocols that automatically assign devices to maximize the total system throughput. We showcase these algorithms in Petals - a decentralized system that runs Llama 2 (70B) and BLOOM (176B) over the Internet up to 10x faster than offloading for interactive generation. We evaluate the performance of our system in simulated conditions and a real-world setup spanning two continents. et.al.|[2312.08361](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08361)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**FoundationPose: Unified 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Novel Objects**|We present FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both model-based and model-free setups. Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions.

|**2023-12-13**|**LD-SDM: Language-Driven Hierarchical Species Distribution Modeling**|We focus on the problem of species distribution modeling using global-scale presence-only data. Most previous studies have mapped the range of a given species using geographical and environmental features alone. To capture a stronger implicit relationship between species, we encode the taxonomic hierarchy of species using a large language model. This enables range mapping for any taxonomic rank and unseen species without additional supervision. Further, we propose a novel proximity-aware evaluation metric that enables evaluating species distribution models using any pixel-level representation of ground-truth species range map. The proposed metric penalizes the predictions of a model based on its proximity to the ground truth. We describe the effectiveness of our model by systematically evaluating on the task of species range prediction, zero-shot prediction and geo-feature regression against the state-of-the-art. Results show our model outperforms the strong baselines when trained with a variety of multi-label learning losses. et.al.|[2312.08334](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08334)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**Efficient Toxic Content Detection by Bootstrapping and Distilling Large Language Models**|Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove inappropriate content that violates community standards. To automate the detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML) approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection. However, both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks. However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging. Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales. DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence. Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%. Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9\% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs. Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability. et.al.|[2312.08303](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08303)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**Conceptualizing Suicidal Behavior: Utilizing Explanations of Predicted Outcomes to Analyze Longitudinal Social Media Data**|The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated mental health crises worldwide, with social isolation and economic instability contributing to a rise in suicidal behavior. Suicide can result from social factors such as shame, abuse, abandonment, and mental health conditions like depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorders. As these conditions develop, signs of suicidal ideation may manifest in social media interactions. Analyzing social media data using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can help identify patterns of suicidal behavior, providing invaluable insights for suicide prevention agencies, professionals, and broader community awareness initiatives. Machine learning algorithms for this purpose require large volumes of accurately labeled data. Previous research has not fully explored the potential of incorporating explanations in analyzing and labeling longitudinal social media data. In this study, we employed a model explanation method, Layer Integrated Gradients, on top of a fine-tuned state-of-the-art language model, to assign each token from Reddit users' posts an attribution score for predicting suicidal ideation. By extracting and analyzing attributions of tokens from the data, we propose a methodology for preliminary screening of social media posts for suicidal ideation without using large language models during inference. et.al.|[2312.08299](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08299)|**[link](https://github.com/fit-suicide-prevention-research/token-attribution-analysis)**|
|**2023-12-14**|**High-throughput Biomedical Relation Extraction for Semi-Structured Web Articles Empowered by Large Language Models**|Objective: To develop a high-throughput biomedical relation extraction system that takes advantage of the large language models' (LLMs) reading comprehension ability and biomedical world knowledge in a scalable and evidential manner. Methods: We formulate the relation extraction task as a simple binary classification problem for large language models such as ChatGPT. Specifically, LLMs make the decision based on the external corpus and its world knowledge, giving the reason for the judgment to factual verification. This method is tailored for semi-structured web articles, wherein we designate the main title as the tail entity and explicitly incorporate it into the context, and the potential head entities are matched based on a biomedical thesaurus. Moreover, lengthy contents are sliced into text chunks, embedded, and retrieved with additional embedding models, ensuring compatibility with the context window size constraints of available open-source LLMs. Results: Using an open-source LLM, we extracted 304315 relation triplets of three distinct relation types from four reputable biomedical websites. To assess the efficacy of the basic pipeline employed for biomedical relation extraction, we curated a benchmark dataset annotated by a medical expert. Evaluation results indicate that the pipeline exhibits performance comparable to that of GPT-4. Case studies further illuminate challenges faced by contemporary LLMs in the context of biomedical relation extraction for semi-structured web articles. Conclusion: The proposed method has demonstrated its effectiveness in leveraging the strengths of LLMs for high-throughput biomedical relation extraction. Its adaptability is evident, as it can be seamlessly extended to diverse semi-structured biomedical websites, facilitating the extraction of various types of biomedical relations with ease. et.al.|[2312.08274](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08274)|null|
|**2023-12-13**|**GuardRails: Automated Suggestions for Clarifying Ambiguous Purpose Statements**|Before implementing a function, programmers are encouraged to write a purpose statement i.e., a short, natural-language explanation of what the function computes. A purpose statement may be ambiguous i.e., it may fail to specify the intended behaviour when two or more inequivalent computations are plausible on certain inputs. Our paper makes four contributions. First, we propose a novel heuristic that suggests such inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs). Using these suggestions, the programmer may choose to clarify the purpose statement (e.g., by providing a functional example that specifies the intended behaviour on such an input). Second, to assess the quality of inputs suggested by our heuristic, and to facilitate future research, we create an open dataset of purpose statements with known ambiguities. Third, we compare our heuristic against GitHub Copilot's Chat feature, which can suggest similar inputs when prompted to generate unit tests. Fourth, we provide an open-source implementation of our heuristic as an extension to Visual Studio Code for the Python programming language, where purpose statements and functional examples are specified as docstrings and doctests respectively. We believe that this tool will be particularly helpful to novice programmers and instructors. et.al.|[2312.08189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08189)|**[link](https://github.com/mrigankpawagi/guardrails)**|
|**2023-12-13**|**Chat-3D v2: Bridging 3D Scene and Large Language Models with Object Identifiers**|Recent research has evidenced the significant potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling challenging tasks within 3D scenes. However, current models are constrained to addressing object-centric tasks, where each question-answer pair focuses solely on an individual object. In real-world applications, users may pose queries involving multiple objects or expect for answers that precisely reference various objects. We introduce the use of object identifiers to freely reference objects during a conversation. While this solution appears straightforward, it presents two main challenges: 1) How to establish a reliable one-to-one correspondence between each object and its identifier? 2) How to incorporate complex spatial relationships among dozens of objects into the embedding space of the LLM? To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage alignment method, which involves learning an attribute-aware token and a relation-aware token for each object. These tokens capture the object's attributes and spatial relationships with surrounding objects in the 3D scene. Once the alignment is established, we can fine-tune our model on various downstream tasks using instruction tuning. Experiments conducted on traditional datasets like ScanQA, ScanRefer, and Nr3D/Sr3D showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method. Additionally, we create a 3D scene captioning dataset annotated with rich object identifiers, with the assistant of GPT-4. This dataset aims to further explore the capability of object identifiers in effective object referencing and precise scene understanding. et.al.|[2312.08168](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08168)|**[link](https://github.com/chat-3d/chat-3d-v2)**|
|**2023-12-14**|**Fine-Grained Image-Text Alignment in Medical Imaging Enables Cyclic Image-Report Generation**|To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive patch-word Matching (AdaMatch) model to correlate chest X-ray (CXR) image regions with words in medical reports and apply it to CXR-report generation to provide explainability for the generation process. AdaMatch exploits the fine-grained relation between adaptive patches and words to provide explanations of specific image regions with corresponding words. To capture the abnormal regions of varying sizes and positions, we introduce the Adaptive Patch extraction (AdaPatch) module to acquire the adaptive patches for these regions adaptively. In order to provide explicit explainability for CXR-report generation task, we propose an AdaMatch-based bidirectional large language model for Cyclic CXR-report generation (AdaMatch-Cyclic). It employs the AdaMatch to obtain the keywords for CXR images and `keypatches' for medical reports as hints to guide CXR-report generation. Extensive experiments on two publicly available CXR datasets prove the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance to existing methods. et.al.|[2312.08078](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08078)|null|
